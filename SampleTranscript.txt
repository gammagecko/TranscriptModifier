Microsoft has made an incredible number of things in their 50-year history enough that it's really easy to say that
0:06
nobody knows the whole list they've had their fingers in countless pies and the annals of Microsoft products you never
0:12
knew existed are extensive to put it mildly we could say the tip of the iceberg is Microsoft Bob for instance uh
0:18
further down you've got Windows blackcomb xenex multitasking Doss and somewhere well below the surface you've
0:25
got stuff like Windows multi-point Server a whole host of things that most people have never heard of and that's just counting operating systems there's
0:32
countless forgotten applications too and even Hardware products there's the TV photo viewer the original 2007 surface
0:39
The Sidewinder Gamepad with motion controls and countless other things that made it to Market but can easily be
0:46
missed or forgotten and then there's things that aren't deeper so much as they're on a completely different
0:51
Iceberg and that's where we find response Point Microsoft's first attempt at a Voiceover IP phone system okay
0:59
point of fact before we continue the iceberg in question is labeled Microsoft telepan products and it has plenty of
1:05
company on there there's office communication server which evolved into link server then into Skype for business
1:11
and eventually they dropped that code base and made a new thing called teams so that's at least four major products
1:18
in their telefony portfolio besides this one and each one of those I should mention was slower and clumsier than the
1:23
last uh with teams being the crowning achievement it's the worst and slowest telepan product I've ever used in my
1:29
life life but I'm sure they'll eventually Sunset that in favor of some new thing that's even slower because
1:36
while Microsoft has no idea how to do phones companies keep giving them money to try for no reason that I could tell
1:43
you but as far as I know all those products were entirely software based they weren't completely about telepan
1:49
and they were all targeted at Enterprises this on the other hand is a response Point PBX and this is very
1:56
obviously not an Enterprise product I doubt many corporations would buy a critically important device that looks
2:02
like an Xbox 360 this is to my knowledge their only attempt at a consumer grade
2:07
hardware-based PBX now maybe that doesn't mean anything to you and if so good news kind of the
2:13
point of this product is that it's for people who don't know what pbxs are and it's pretty remarkable in that regard I
2:19
don't think I've seen anything else quite like it but it is kind of hard to summarize what a PBX does concisely
2:27
because they do so much and I usually try to avoid getting into it for that reason now the last time I said that a
2:33
bunch of people insisted they wanted me to get into it and I will eventually but not in this video because it'd be 3
2:40
hours before we saw this thing actually running I'll summarize it a bit later but I'm here to talk about this thing so
2:46
let me show you what this thing does this is a phone this is another
2:51
phone and this is a network cable all right and here's what it all
2:57
does
3:03
it makes phone calls that's what pbxs do I mean there's hundreds of other potential capabilities but job one is
3:09
just to connect calls between phones either between extensions like this or to people from outside the
3:18
office this is a Voiceover IP or VoIP PBX which means that it doesn't use
3:24
traditional phone lines but I'm making this call from my actual cell phone it's going to an ordinary phone number it's
3:29
connected to an online Gateway service that lets the call come in over an Ethernet cable so I don't have to get an actual phone line delivered to my studio
3:37
it's very convenient and indeed Voiceover IP is
PBX limitations
3:42
largely a product of convenience before VoIP entered the picture big businesses had to pay for huge bundles of phone
3:49
lines or expensive Digital Phone trunks but VoIP works over any ordinary internet connection and you only have to
3:55
pay for the Gateway service which is much cheaper than traditional telefony and even if you're a small business that
4:00
only needs a few lines it simplifies things to combine your phone service with your broadband connection now I'm
4:07
talking about businesses here because they're nearly the only market for phone systems in the US it's different in some
4:13
other places the German company AVM gmbh there's got to be a way to
4:18
pronounce that but I don't know what it is has sold about a billion home pbxs under their fritzbox brand and I assume
4:26
they sell them in places other than Germany but I don't really know what I can say is is that consumer pbxs are not
4:31
a thing in the US if an American Home has a phone it's a plain old telephone set plugged into a plain old Jack as
4:38
it's always been to the people watching who know the Deep American ISDN lore uh
4:43
ISDN dni oh and vage doesn't count that's just a simulation of a phone jack
4:48
the point is most pbxs are intended for businesses but even then there's different types of business with very
4:53
different needs the phone systems used at a Wall Street trading firm Are enormous expensive and incredi powerful
5:00
because they need to be for many years they were based on the same equipment used by actual phone companies and in
5:05
time they exceeded what even those systems could do but what Wall Street needs is very different from what a
5:11
supermarket needs or a factory or a new car dealership or a used car dealership or a pharmacy in a small town in Kansas
5:18
these are all wildly different applications but the industry has largely delivered just one product for
5:24
decades and it's basically just the thing they made for Wall Street uh I did turn up support for small and
5:30
mediumsized business phone systems for over 10 years and nearly all of their systems were virtually identical almost
5:36
none of them used more than three or four basic features that were built into almost every PBX ever made but despite
5:43
this the product we sold had hundreds of features which very few of them ever understood and they really just got in
5:48
the way it's never been easy to buy a PBX it was simple to configure in fact until recently many companies had to
5:55
retain full-time employees just to run the damn things back in the mid 80s for instance uh popular systems like the
6:01
AT&T Merlin could only be configured by sitting down at a telephone set and entering long strings of numbers blindly
6:08
into an audio prompt later systems from companies like Nell and Panasonic could be programmed through a tur menu on a
6:14
two-line LCD or sometimes through a Serial console and that was better but it was still nothing an end user could
6:20
handle and while the leading pbxs all got graphical PC based uis in the 9s
6:25
they remained incredibly dense and inaccessible because they were just too comp
6:30
even a low-end small office unit like a Nell bcm50 which is barely bigger than the phones it serves is still modeled
6:37
after the Monstrous multi- cabinet systems that run tens of thousands of lines in skyscrapers a very simple
6:43
question like how do I change this user's phone number becomes a lot harder to answer in a system that supports
6:49
features like least cost trunk routing that feature is utterly irrelevant to any office with less than a thousand
6:56
employees and most that do have that many but the architecture that makes it possible forces every administrator to
7:02
understand it even if they don't intend to use it so configuring these things has always been hard besides that the
7:09
end user experience also has rough edges which really never got polished off even now when I was working in the field I
7:15
never stopped getting calls from people who just couldn't seem to learn how to do basic things like transfer a call or
7:21
even dial people by extension and really I don't blame them if you're working at a job you know actually working doing
7:28
stuff to advance the needs of the business and one of the things you need to do is to call Bobs and douget your
7:33
boss in the back office Translating that on the fly into I need to dial 103 on my
7:39
phone is an abstraction that a lot of people just can't handle some folks are just bad at calling numbers especially
7:45
on top of whatever else they're busy with so what do you do you just look towards the back office and go hey Bob
7:50
come out here for a second that's not ideal so wouldn't it be better if you could just say to your
7:56
phone call Bobs and dougnut bobon douget and it would just do
8:02
it this is the Dual thesis of response point it's a phone system that's easy to
8:07
configure and easy to use something you could sell to the pharmacy in Kansas with three employees and the guy who
8:13
owns the place will run it himself that's an underserved market and providing for it is a brilliant idea but
8:20
it's kind of at odds with who was trying to do it response point was made by an
Response Point origins
8:25
internal Microsoft Skunk Works called the speech Technology Group headed up by one Jong hang but there's almost more
8:32
info to be found about that guy than the product the guy seems to have a pretty big resume with regards to speech
8:38
recognition and I don't want to belittle any achievements there but almost everything I can find about him or the
8:44
speech Technology Group reeks of uh for instance one of the first results you'll get on Google is an
8:51
article for the i e called creating a startup inside an Enterprise which is 10,000 words of generic self-help crap
8:58
that boils down to if you want to get noticed and Pat out your resume find an executive and brown knows him until they
9:03
let you spend a bunch of money on a whim and that seems to have worked but as
9:08
with most business people and most Ventures by business people it feels like the product was just an excuse to
9:15
start a business and not the other way around indeed I found another article on this guy from Microsoft's own site which
9:21
is full of even more brainworm nonsense Act Fast Ponder less and learn he says
9:28
yeah man do you live laugh love too it's it's gobbledygook but if you read between the word salad it seems clear
9:34
what happened here the object of this group was legit they were put together to develop general purpose voice
9:40
recognition software but not any specific product so once they had something that worked they needed to
9:45
find a product to put it in and someone just came up with the idea of a phone system they just brainstormed and oh why
9:51
don't we do this it was a means to an end and that's concerning especially given who we're talking about here as I
9:58
said Microsoft keep keeps making phone systems and every one of them is bad I believe this is because only phone
10:04
people understand phones computer people you know programmers always want to impose computer esque workflows on them
10:10
and they confuse the hell out of users and admins alike sure enough Microsoft does this a lot my job used to force me
10:18
to use and administer Microsoft teams so I know both sides of it I don't know which part I hate more the app sucks but
10:24
the dashboard is incomprehensible very simple tasks take out hours to complete and it's because
10:31
the people who made it have no experience with phones they don't understand what admins need or how it
10:36
should all fit together and even once you find the settings you need the system only promises that they'll take effect within 7 days I you not I I
10:45
don't know if I'll find this picture on Google Images but I this is a message that I got from teams every time I changed something and they weren't
10:51
kidding my changes never took effect in less than 24 hours and sometimes it was longer and this is what I expect from
10:58
people who mostly work in cloud computing you know masses of anonymous nodes that you never look at directly
11:03
and the only thing that matters is eventual consistency if that's your wheelhouse then you won't understand
11:08
that when someone calls it and asks to have their name changed that needs to happen right away that user can't have
11:15
the wrong name showing up on other people's phones when they call them for a whole week but Microsoft has always been more about submit a ticket then
11:22
I'll get right on that so the question is were they able to think small enough to make this thing make sense
11:29
let's find out now first off we need to get into it but there's uh no real local interface to speak of on the front we
First impressions
11:36
have this little LCD screen but it doesn't do much it just shows you the current IP address unfortunately however
11:41
you don't even need that all you need is a Windows PC we'll use this one to
11:47
access this system all you do is install the Microsoft response Point administrator it automatically searches
11:53
the network and finds any RP units you have so you just select the one you want put in your password and and just like
11:59
that you're in now every other pvx that I'm familiar with requires you to manually punch in an IP address or
12:06
connect to a Serial port on the physical device or other things that are just completely out of the question for the
12:12
guy running a small town Pharmacy so this system has already cleared a major hurdle by just letting the user get into
12:18
it it's a point to Microsoft and once you're in you get this very simple list
12:23
of objects and tasks and again this is already a massive improvement over the typical PBX experience
12:29
see the Nell BCM management software looks like this and the Avia IP office
12:36
software looks like this and the Samsung office serve software looks like this so
12:42
even as an expert on phones in general you will have no idea where to begin with any of these you simply have to be
12:49
an expert to know anything at all but in response point it's hard not to know
12:55
what you're doing I mean are you here to edit a user you just click on the user user if you're here to edit a phone you
13:00
just click edit phone everything isn't buried six menus deep and named weird
13:06
stuff like endpoints or subscribers conventional pbxs are so close to the Telco gear that they originally
13:12
descended from that they can't even commit to calling a user a user response point on the other hand knows exactly
13:18
where it's being used and who's using it and what things they're trying to do so they call a user a user a phone is a
13:25
phone a line is a line it's all very straightforward but what is a user and how is it
PBX crash course
13:32
separate from a phone and how is that separate from a line I said I wouldn't get into it but none of this will make
13:38
any sense unless you have some grounding on what problem pbxs Are Meant to solve
13:44
so we need a crash course nowadays we pretty much all have cell phones right
13:49
but go back to the 80s or 90s and obviously most people couldn't afford them yet so you'll find that most folks
13:55
back then just have a single phone line at home now that's inconvenient if you're household has more than one
14:00
occupant if somebody's on the phone nobody else can use it right now most people just put up with that but if you
14:05
were Rich you'd often get two lines then two people could make calls at once duck but I think that was probably it I I
14:12
doubt that even the very rich bothered to get three or four lines even if there were more people living in the house you
14:18
could um but I've never heard of anybody doing it and I think it's just because statistically it's not likely that three
14:25
people are really going to need to be on the phone simultaneously and it works pretty much the same way at businesses
14:30
even today they make and receive a lot of calls but it's rare for every employee of a business to be on the
14:36
phone at once if you're an insurance company with 100 employees on average maybe 20 will be on the phone at any
14:42
given moment well you don't need a 100 phone lines then you can do with a pool of 20 maybe 25 for a safety margin and
14:49
that's good enough the trouble is how do you connect 100 phones to only 25 lines
14:55
the math doesn't make sense so enter the PBX a little box that sits between your office phones and the outside world you
15:02
can think of a PBX sort of like a Broadband router you know how your ISP gives you a single IP address but your
15:08
router lets you plug in 50 devices and they can all use that one IP at once it's the same thing you can plug as
15:15
little as one phone line into a PBX then put as many phones behind it as you want
15:20
when someone wants to make a call they just pick up their handset and the PBX connects it to that one shared line now
15:26
of course phones aren't packet based like internet connections so the line will be tied up until that one call is
15:32
over but the PBX will make sure everyone knows the line is busy so you don't get any rude interruptions so that's job one
15:39
job two of course is handling incoming calls going with the router analogy again maybe you know about Network
15:45
address translation or natat if you don't it's the magic that lets your PCS share one internet connection but
15:52
another thing that it offers as much as netsec people hate hearing this is basic security it blocks all unknown incoming
15:59
traffic such as botn Nets trying to hack your PC now this isn't on purpose of course it's just a side effect and it's
16:05
because there's no rule for what to do with an unknown incoming packet so it just gets thrown away this is convenient
16:11
on your home broadband router but when you're talking about a phone system you want random inbound connections to go
16:17
somewhere so that customers can call you so when a call comes in the pvx needs to be told which of your hundred phones
16:23
should receive it should it ring everybody in the office or a specific person if it's after hours should it go
16:29
to a voicemail box or get forwarded to someone's cell phone these and many other decisions have to be made by
16:35
management then implemented in the PBX now once a call is in progress you might
16:40
need to change how it's set up Say by transferring it to a cooworker this is where users come in or subscribers or
16:47
extensions or seats or a dozen other names depending on the system basically every phone behind a PBX is usually
16:54
bound to an identity of some kind there'll be a user profile that has at minimum an extension three or four
17:00
digits that can be dialed like a phone number so this guy here is 100 this guy here is 601 and this gives you an
17:06
address to send transfers to or to just call
17:13
directly this is one of the other important features of pbxs if you want to call a cooworker you don't need to
17:18
involve any outside phone lines you just dial their extension and the PBX connects your two sets internally in a
17:24
company with thousands of employees there might be hundreds of concurrent calls going on inside the office and
17:30
with a PBX you don't pay a penny for any of it because you own all the infrastructure now once again with the
17:36
router analogy though an extension is like a local IP address your PCS can talk to each other within your network
17:42
using their local IPS but those addresses aren't valid in the greater internet you only get one IP that other
17:48
people in the world can reach however in your router you can set up Port forwards to allow inbound traffic from the
17:54
outside world to reach those private IPS and the same thing is true with people pbxs if you order multiple numbers from
18:01
your phone service provider your PBX can map those to specific extensions so callers can reach specific people by
18:08
dialing specific numbers it's a feature called direct inward dialing okay that was a lot of talking and fortunately
18:15
that's it those are the absolute fundamentals the capabilities that every PBX in existence offers going back like
18:23
80 years okay these are the universal things and after that we get into
18:29
features every business needs different sets of features I mean some need none but many need lots there are thousands
18:36
of features they differ wildly between systems and even if two machines from different manufacturers have the same
18:42
feature they'll rarely call it by the same name this starts out with things like music on hold uh automatic call
18:49
forwarding voicemail then you escalate to directory Services interactive menus voice recognition facts to email bulk
18:55
dialing just to name a few things at the far end of the Spectrum you've got uh stuff like computer telephony
19:01
integration or CTI uh example if you work in a modern call center when your phone rings the customer account info
19:07
will just pop up on your screen automatically it's a thing called a screen pop the PBX has a feature that
19:12
sends the caller ID to your PC and that looks it up in a database uh also uh if you're at a grocery store and you hear
19:18
an automated voice overhead say call waiting for bakery department two oh2 that's a feature called parking page
19:26
that I think was made pretty much exclusively for supermarket markets and big Vox stores and the list goes on and
19:31
on and on and of course like I said most businesses don't need any of it and it
19:37
serves mostly just to confuse people response Point pairs away almost all of those confusing features it has very
19:43
little besides the fundamentals phones users and lines but those Concepts exist
19:49
on every PBX the basics are Universal but they're usually mind-numbing to set
19:54
up if you have an Avia or a mitel or God forbid an asterisk box there's just no chance in hell of a non-expert figuring
20:01
out where to begin so let's pretend that we're a new admin who just got this out of the box plugged it in and knows
User setup & features
20:07
nothing about it I'm going to wipe this system and we're going to take it from the top now I think that even the total neoy would start by setting up their
20:14
connection to the outside world and we do that by clicking add voice service
20:19
now that's not quite as clear as one would hope uh you'd think it would just say add outside lines but since this is
20:26
a Voiceover IP system I think that's kind of iffy um lines implies a finite set of channels and that isn't
20:33
necessarily applicable I mean it is if you actually do use physical phone lines
20:38
and to be fair that is possible on this particular unit uh see these jacks on the back of the uh PBX I know I said
20:45
this was a Voiceover IP system and it is but it has a built-in adapter that
20:50
converts up to four analog phone lines into a viip format that may seem kind of silly to get such a modern device and
20:57
then hook it up to an ancient analog log service but in some places you just can't get reliable Broadband especially
21:03
in 2007 when this first came out so this was a must and that module does show up
21:08
as a set of individual lines in the UI here but most people would probably get this for VoIP I think and those Services
21:16
can deliver an indefinite number of calls at once basically as many as your internet connection can handle uh each
21:22
individual VoIP call only uses about 150 kilobits in both directions so if you have a 50 megabit service that's about
21:29
300 concurrent calls if I did my math right now many vo providers will charge you per session so you might have to
21:35
order just um 20 or 30 channels ahead of time but others just charge by the minute and allow as many concurrent
21:41
calls as you can send them so representing VoIP Service as a pool of lines doesn't really make sense also um
21:49
this thing probably scales quite a bit more than it seems at first Microsoft's brochures for response Point say that
21:55
it's intended for businesses with 50 employees or less but there doesn't seem to be any actual hard limits on anything
22:02
many pbxs do have limits based either on arbitrary license restraints or on
22:07
Hardware constraints but this doesn't seem to have any the help file mentions nothing about them and it does say that
22:13
you can connect as many phones as you like they just recommend sticking to no more than 200 because it might bog down
22:19
the CPU but it sounds like you could blow way past 50 users and probably have everyone in a call simultaneously
22:26
without much trouble so yeah they didn't really want to limit what this interface could display anyway if we were using
22:33
analog service setting it up would be a matter of just plugging the cables in but for VoIP we have to set up an account with our provider so we hit add
22:41
voice service and immediately get confused by this dialogue not all response Point units were the same a
22:48
topic we'll get into later this one does have the built-in analog ports so those show up automatically but many of these
22:55
things only had an Ethernet Jack nothing else so if you were forced to use analog
23:00
lines or a T1 or PRI uh which are special digital phone lines that are commonly used by businesses there'd be
23:06
nowhere to connect them on the unit itself Microsoft solution were adapters that would accept those Services convert
23:13
them into Voiceover IP and then plug into your network and the base unit could discover them uh fortunately we
23:18
don't have any of those uh we have VoIP and the second one does say that so we just pick that now apparently Microsoft
23:25
ran a database of service provider data back in the day you could pick like um uh I don't know 8x8 or ring central or
23:33
whoever and it would automatically put in all the proxy information and stuff like that I don't want to get too deep
23:39
into that but it was probably a really bad idea probably never worked very well and in any case the service is long gone
23:44
so we just have to go in here and pick other provider and response Point gently suggests that we go look at a list of
23:52
approved carriers before you proceed now you might think this is just a co-branding opportunity but the truth is
23:57
every PBS X vendor has a list of providers that they know work with their gear and often they have a list of
24:03
providers they know won't there are wildly different implementations of the common VoIP protocols and in some cases
24:09
a given service literally cannot work with a given PBX case in point I found a
24:15
KB article from someone called onsip that says you can use response point with them but they don't recommend it
24:21
because your users will have to dial four zeros before every number and I don't want to get into why this happens
24:27
it'll make both our brains hurt but suffice to say this kind of compatibility crap is commonplace in this industry and uh things don't get
24:34
much better on the next screen that sure is a lot of fields with a lot of labels
24:40
address of record URI off ID proxy address these don't mean anything guess
24:47
what they hardly mean anything to me either if you sign up with six different VI providers you'll get six different
24:53
sets of credentials some with more Fields than this some with fewer and they'll all have different names for
24:58
every field it's a notorious problem with Voiceover IP and it's Universal so um the only way out of this one is to
25:04
hope that our providers support staff can help us muddle through trust me they spend half their day doing just that so
25:10
supposing we figure all that out the next page wants to know about direct dial numbers this is the thing I mentioned earlier you can have specific
25:17
numbers connect straight through to people's direct extensions uh this is usually called direct inw dial I guess
25:23
Microsoft thought that one extra word was confusing but in any case we can't actually set this up without any users
25:29
so we'll just move on next it asks what caller ID setting we want fun fact uh
25:34
did you know that an enormous number of phone service providers will let you send any call or ID that you like with
25:40
no verification that you own that number just a fun little fact responsible providers however limit you to numbers
25:46
you own and in truth the majority just ignore what you send and overwrite it with whatever the first number you
25:52
ordered with them was so most of the time you can just leave this empty and that's what our provider will probably tell us when we call them in confusion
25:59
so we just hit next we give it a name and just like that we have access to the
26:05
outside world next of course we need some users so we'll hit add user now most pbxs will offer you hundreds of
26:12
settings at this stage uh this one gives you three name extension directory
26:17
listing the name is important because it appears on other people's phones when you call them but also because it shows
26:23
up in the company directory we'll talk a bit more about that later but suffice to say it's a feature that lets callers
26:29
hear an automated listing of all your employees and call anyone they like without needing to talk to a receptionist first it's a neat feature
26:36
some companies are going to want it some won't but even if you do want it you might not want to put everyone in it uh
26:42
for instance your CEO uh probably doesn't want random angry customers calling in and going hm I could probably
26:47
just say the guy's name here and then I get to yell at him directly so there's an option to hide specific users from
26:54
that directory but still let people reach them if they know their name and another to block those calls entirely
27:00
the last thing here is the extension number now some systems will let you set longer extensions uh but this one is
27:06
limited to exactly three digits now that's not a big deal obviously you aren't going to put a thousand users
27:12
behind this thing and shorter extensions well those would be convenient but most systems won't allow them for complicated
27:18
phone reasons so this is pretty much power for the course what's strange though is that once you've created a
27:24
user you can't change their extension now it's not that Comm that you need to do that it's just weird that you can't
27:31
on the other hand though pbxs often have a lot of loosely coupled moving parts
27:36
inside like the uh voicemail system will be an independent internal component so this probably avoided a lot of coding
27:42
effort to keep those parts synchronized uh and indeed the last setting here would be the password that's for the
27:48
voicemail system primarily and every new user just gets it set to 9999 the first time they log in It'll ask them to
27:54
change it which is the best way to do it because admins us usually forget to write down whatever they put here now
28:00
speaking of voicemail there's a tab for that and there aren't a whole lot of options now in a lot of older pbxs
28:07
voicemail was entirely optional but for a small business it's pretty much mandatory so it's good that Microsoft
28:12
built it in this system is very simplistic though every user gets voicemail by default and I can't imagine
28:20
why you'd bother turning it off but I guess you could and you can also leave
28:25
the voicemail enabled but not allow someone to listen to it through their phone and I can't imagine why You' do
28:31
that either in fact I think this is such a weird option that nobody ever noticed that it doesn't work I tried turning it
28:38
off but nothing happens the final setting here though is to forward voicemails to an email address and this
28:44
is actually incredibly useful this sends you a wave file of every voicemail so you can save that on your PC and have a
28:50
permanent record of every message you've ever received also if you have a companywide voicemail box you can have
28:55
the messages emailed to everyone so people don't have to walk over to a single phone to check and see if there's a message waiting you can even have it
29:02
email multiple addresses so this is actually a very well implemented feature and of course you can record a voicemail
29:08
greeting but uh we'll actually come back to that later finally we've got the call handling tab which opens with some
29:14
esoteric options this is actually a weird kind of privacy feature that seems
29:20
to be unique to this PBX see a lot of phone systems offer a paging feature where you can call someone and their
29:26
phone will just turn on its speaker so they can hear you right so i' I'd pick this up and I'd dial him and this would
29:32
just immediately go off hook and I could go hey Steve can you come over and grab the phone I guess I don't exactly know what
29:38
you use paging for instead of just calling someone but it's in every single system at any rate uh response Point
29:45
enhances this with another feature called intercom which is the exact same thing except it turns on the mic too so
29:54
I page you your phone goes off hook I can now talk lock at you and I can hear
29:59
whatever's going on in your office anything that's going on in your office
30:05
at that moment I'd love to demo these but there'd be terrible feedback if I did
30:11
I'll probably punch something in here in a moment hey Steve you got a call on line
30:20
too obviously there are privacy concerns with letting someone turn on a hot mic in your office remotely so we have an
30:28
option to turn that off entirely and we have an option to leave it on but to make it beep periodically so uh you know
30:34
if somebody enables this while you're out of the office and then you walk in you know you might be there for a few
30:40
seconds before you realize it but then it'll go beep and you'll go hey wait a minute somebody's listening in on me so
30:45
those are good except that they default to intercom on warning beep off and that
30:51
may seem nuts but remember this is intended for tiny businesses right there's less concern than there would be
30:57
in a huge company about like weird office politics and whatnot also when
31:03
you intercom the phone plays a deafening chime that's pretty much impossible to
31:09
miss the other thing is that small business operators hate bumping into Security checks that only make sense for
31:15
huge companies everything their system can do they want it to just be on and immediately usable and to not try and
31:21
protect them from themselves and honestly that's usually the right choice so I kind of think this is reasonable
31:28
anyway the uh final option here is call forwarding if you don't pick up your call after a few rings you can have it either go to your voicemail or go to
31:36
another internal extension or get forwarded to an external number or just go nowhere at all and that's it we've
31:44
created our user that is every single user specific option in the entire system and I I can't overstate how
31:51
simplified this is compared to a Nortel or something there's fewer options by orders of magnitude I mean
31:58
just to pick one in a real PBX you need to choose which outside lines this user
32:03
has access to response point doesn't have that feature a line is a line it's first come first serve and that's
32:10
probably the right call the vast majority of businesses have no need for priority or cost-based trunk routing and
32:17
those options complicate the interface tremendously but on the other hand there's a lot of stuff missing here that
32:23
would infuriate me um I can't override this user's outbound caller ID for instance there's no option to forward
32:29
all calls preemptively before they ring or to ignore calls from specific numbers to ignore Anonymous callers um to block
32:36
international dialing these are things that I depended on in my job every day like every single customer wanted to use
32:43
these but to be fair I was mostly working with medium-sized businesses
32:48
when you have a 100 employees or more you can't know them all you can't trust them all you know one of them might come
32:54
in and decide to use the office phone to call their boyfriend in Austria and run up a $50,000 bill that you have to pay
33:00
for but in a real mom and pop setting if that happens someone gets a spanking you
33:06
know a feed shop is too small for institutional style controls social controls are generally enough and they
33:12
typically don't get in your way as much and we'll talk more about who exactly
33:17
the target market for This was later but let's just continue the tour for the moment the one remaining basic element
Phone config
33:23
is the phones themselves um I've got these two phones hooked up but you can see from the in light that uh they can't
33:29
reach the pvx it's cuz they're not configured once we've created a user we have to assign a phone to it and this is
33:35
as simple as it could possibly be we hit add phone we tell it yes we plugged in
33:40
the phone and powered it on believe me you got to force people to check that and there we go it detects the two
33:47
phones on the network so we just pick one and we tell it that we want this to have Steve as the primary user we can
33:54
give it a name if we want yeah defaults to Steve Apple phone and that's it it's configuring the phone and in a moment
34:02
Boop it's ready to use I'll just run through that real quick for the other user [Music]
34:12
here and now our system is ready to
34:19
use I just revealed that this phone handset is not plugged in my movie Magic is ruined I have reasons for it okay I I
34:26
should point out that in a lot of lesson systems even if the setup was that fast you have to like reboot the phones a
34:32
bunch of times to get them set up or swap between users or whatever in this one you don't everything is
34:38
instantaneous it's perfect and at this point we're pretty much done our phones
34:44
have names and numbers and we can place calls and if you're at least a little bit with it this whole process from
34:50
taking stuff out of the box to this point has taken less than 15 minutes I can't say that that's faster than any
34:57
other PBX I've ever used that's probably an exaggeration but it's pretty damn impressive for a machine you don't need
35:03
to know anything to operate now of course we're not quite
35:08
done next we need to handle inbound calls although if you're following The Logical flow of the UI you'll actually
Other system features
35:14
end up on the base unit tab next so let's take a look at that this is mostly maintenance features you know you can
35:19
see uh the event log how much storage is available on the internal hard drive uh set the base unit password date and time
35:27
uh but you can also set up your email server for uh voicemail to email forwarding and it's where you can set up your hold music I mean it says Park
35:34
music and we'll come back to that later it's a real topic but it's basically hold music every company wants this um
35:40
when you put a customer on hold if there's just dead air they'll hang up um so hold music's been mandatory ever
35:45
since it was invented uh by default though this just plays a built-in wave file
36:06
and obviously a lot of customers would want to change that he says knowing full
36:12
well that most don't uh Cisco call manager is sort of famous for this it also comes with a default built-in wave
36:18
file which virtually no customer bothers changing and this is why almost every person on this planet has heard this
36:25
piece of music
36:35
[Music]
36:57
[Applause] [Music]
37:07
but an awful lot of people do want to change it so it's unfortunate that this doesn't let you upload your own wave
37:12
file you can either use the built-in music or you can plug something in the input jack on the base station um a
37:18
radio a CD player whatever not that that's legal um you're supposed to go
37:24
pay musac for an actual licensed music on hold Source but nobody in the Target demo of this thing would have bothered
37:30
little secret for you I've never heard of anyone bothering so it's going to be a CD or a radio but anyway that's about
37:36
it so now we can move on to call routing this page is where we would set up all of our inbound call routing normally
Inbound call features
37:42
that would be the next step in setting up a PBX but what's most interesting about this one is we don't actually have
37:48
to do that at all so this phone here is on an external viip service it's not connected to the response Point Network
37:54
at all it might as well be like a cell phone or something so I'm just going to call the primary number on the response
38:00
Point here which I did not
38:08
memorize thank you for calling please say the name of the person or group you would like to talk to Steve
38:14
Apple transferring to Steve Apple remember when I said this product
38:21
was developed by the speech Technologies Group the technology in question was speech recognition uh out of the box the
38:27
response Point has what's usually called an auto attendant literally a computerized replacement for a phone
38:33
attendant or receptionist any inbound calls to any number that goes to this system go to that auto attendant and
38:39
callers can just ask for whoever they want to talk to that's the company directory that I was talking about earlier this is really remarkable I
38:46
think this might be the only PBX I've ever seen with a default inbound route most vendors are unwilling to make that
38:53
many assumptions about how your system works but of course at most businesses that's a perfectly safe thing to do most
38:59
people who would install this would probably want exactly this Behavior so it's not just 15 minutes to get the
39:05
phones basically working it's 15 minutes to be genuinely ready to run your
39:10
business but of course not everyone will want it to work exactly like this that menu is very impersonal so there are
39:17
some settings here on a real PBX inbound call flows are incredibly confuted in some cases they're almost tearing
39:23
complete but here it boils down to one question who will answer calls by
39:29
default everything goes to the auto attendant although Microsoft calls that an automated receptionist again probably
39:34
the right call uh but you can instead have calls go to an actual person uh or
39:40
choose one or the other the uh computer or the person based on time of day so
39:45
you can go in here and set up uh your hours of operation for each day of the week uh which days you're open then you
39:51
can go in and add specific holidays to notch out of that as an override it's actually a quite well implement
39:57
but one thing that is a bit odd here is uh if you go with the auto attendant approach if somebody calls in and they
40:04
either you know refuse to use the menu so they just start hammering the zero key who hasn't been there uh or if the
40:10
system can't understand them then you can pick a user to forward them to to you know figure out what they want to do
40:17
and that's the operator so you can choose an operator separately from a receptionist and I'm trying to imagine
40:24
what small business would have two different people for those functions you think it would just go with the
40:29
receptionist weird but you can do it if you want and um that's it those are our
Limitations
40:36
options it's a very simple way to look at inbound call handling and for the most part I like that Simplicity but
40:43
it's also where we start to run into trouble because honestly they've oversimplified here conventional systems
40:49
have too many options this has too few uh for instance a universal PBX feature
40:55
is the ring group or hunt group uh that allows you to add users to a list then when a call comes in it'll ring the
41:02
first person and if they don't pick up it rings the second and so on until someone answers or you can configure it
41:08
to ring all users at once or do it based on who most recently got a call many other algorithms and if it rings for too
41:15
long you can usually have it go to like a common voicemail box all sorts of things but the point is it's an
41:20
extremely common desire that response Point does not deliver in any way Microsoft's only acknowledgement of this
41:27
is a link here that says how do I let multiple people answer incoming calls and if you click this it gives you um
41:33
actually quite a complicated process um when I first saw this I'm like wow
41:39
that's a lot of steps and a lot of bold text so let me boil this down for you
41:44
what they want you to do is to come back here and add a new user and up top you
41:49
should pick job roll now I skipped over this when we first looked at it cuz I have no idea what this means a user
41:56
could be a person a group a job Ro or a location what I mean I mean I can
42:02
vaguely understand what those might do the trouble is if I flip between them I
42:09
can't really see anything specific that it does do it almost feels like it's only there to help people who can't like
42:16
grock the abstraction of a user can be either a specific person or a generic
42:22
phone assigned to a particular purpose um you know like a smoke screen just to
42:27
make it make sense but I don't think it actually does anything under the hood so
42:33
look if I'm confused by this that's not good news for response point but anyway we create our job rooll and we say it's
42:39
I don't know incoming users uh and then we go to call routing and we set that
42:46
job roll as the default receptionist and now we come back and we edit each of the
42:51
phones for these users and in the shared user field we assign this job roll we've
42:58
created are you confused yet can we do this for the second one as well okay and
43:04
now it says it should work so let's give it a shot okay well both phones are ringing
43:12
and I can pick it up from either one so that worked right well sort of the
43:17
trouble is this isn't a real ring group it's leveraging a feature that most systems called shared lines or bridged
43:24
line appearances basically you're just binding a second user to each phone as
43:29
if that were their primary device what does any of that mean don't don't worry about it the the point is
43:35
the reason this matters is because uh if we go to the call history here it's
43:40
actually quite a nice interface for viewing the call history by the way many systems don't make it nearly this slick let's see um who answered that call this
43:48
is my external phone and it was answered by incoming users oh wait a minute oh
43:54
I'm sorry I'm full of I was just about to tell you uh that there's no way to find out which user actually picked
44:00
it up it just says that that group did but actually if you hover over it it
44:05
does say that it was answered on the phone called Bobs and dougnut phone which is what I assigned to that user so
44:12
okay well I look a little sillier than I expected right now but the point is this is a half-ass feature this isn't how we
44:18
do this okay every PBX ever made has a ring group feature but not this one and
44:25
even if the call history wasn't accurate does that really matter I mean in in a tiny business like the ones we're
44:31
talking about here you're not going to be doing this sort of forensic stuff digging through the logs to figure out who made a call uh but it's just the
44:38
principle of the matter and it's particularly confusing because it seems like it would be really easy to
44:43
implement just make this a multi-choice list it obviously supports delivering
44:48
calls to multiple users at once they just didn't put it in the UI and that's a huge Miss and um there's sort of
44:56
problems with the underlying feature this is leveraging too let's uh go back to the phone wizard here okay so we can
45:03
bind up to four users to each physical phone that's a very common feature like I said it's a bridge line appearances
45:10
and that's used for things like um letting a secretary answer calls going to her boss right so we put him on the
45:18
second line on this phone and now if somebody calls Bob Steve's phone rings now if he knows Bob is there he can just
45:24
let it ring until he picks up or if Bob has said I don't want to be disturbed right now then Steve can answer and if
45:31
the person actually has a legit reason to bother his boss then he can pass it through to them great this is an
45:37
important feature and response Point technically supports it but it doesn't support it very well a typical Voiceover
45:44
IP phone does support multiple identities you can see here that I've got two phone lines assigned to this uh
45:49
Clive and Bob and if I dial one of these
45:57
you can see that this line key is lit up and it says the call was answered by Bob so it's obvious who this call was
46:03
intended for but let's try this the other way around I'm going to set up inbound calls
46:09
so they all go to Bob then we'll just call the main
46:14
number both phones ring but there's no indication on the screen of who they
46:21
were trying to reach so if I'm Steve and I picked this up I don't know that they were calling for Bob so I'm going to say
46:27
hi this is Steve and the caller is going to have to ask why aren't you Bob it's awkward um particularly for
46:35
internal calls right uh even if I had a third phone here and I called Bob it would ring on Steve's phone too it's
46:42
obviously undesired behavior and there's no way around it and the problems kind of uh continue to stack up as as we go
46:49
on here uh for instance suppose we do want to use that uh automated receptionist well these are all the
46:55
settings it has and this is um pathetic is the word the only real choices we
47:01
have are to disable the automated directory you know so somebody who's calling in has to already have an
47:06
extension um or they have to just hit zero and talk to the human receptionist and then we could turn on three
47:13
questions what are your hours what is your location and what is your fax number that's it now to their credit the
Cool message recording UI
47:20
way that you can figure these is extremely slick um recording messages for auto attendants and um like
47:25
automated out of office messages and stuff like that is a huge hurdle for most users but uh here it's actually
47:32
really straightforward uh so if we hit the configure button for what your hours we have the option to manually upload a
47:39
file to the base unit users don't understand that workflow you can explain it any way you like and they just won't
47:46
get it you'll have to do it for them but check this out let's hit record new okay
47:52
it asks us to pick a phone let's pick Steve's phone then we'll just hit record and we get a call at the beep please
47:59
record your prompt when you are finished click the button labeled stop on the screen of your
48:05
computer we are located in the bowels of hell just past the eighth Circle turnoff next to the lake of flaming blood now
48:12
there are pbxs that can call your phone to have you record a message like this but the ones I've seen force you to use
48:18
this awkward Touch Tone interface to handle it so yes it calls you yes it starts recording when you're done you
48:23
have to hit pound and if you want to hear what you just recorded you have to hit star users hate this right but here
48:30
if we want to hear what we just recorded we are located in the bowels of hell just past the eighth Circle turnoff next
48:36
to the lake of flaming blood we just hit play on the PC and if we want to re-record it we hit record if we like it
48:42
we hit okay and that's it this process works so well and is so intuitive that even if you're utterly clueless you
48:48
could just bang through these in no time at all let's some let's do the greeting thanks for calling Microsoft response
48:54
point where our response always gets to the point if you know the party you'd like to reach just say their name
49:00
otherwise say operator all right that's most of them and finally let's do the uh hours of operation oh we're always
49:08
open all right that's it all my messages have been recorded and that took me like
49:13
2 minutes it's fantastic this is a terrific workflow every system should
49:18
use this and it even applies to voicemail like suppose I'm the boss or whatever and one of my employees says
49:24
hey I need to re-record my voicemail greeting I can't figure it out I can just go in here to that user hit
49:31
specify and send a call to their phone at the of course now that I think about
49:36
it uh I would have to hit stop for them oh that doesn't work as well as I thought it would well okay the point is
49:43
this system definitely has uh some Innovations and even some brilliant ideas in it but you've pretty much seen
49:51
everything at this point and it's missing a whole bunch of fundamentals so for instance this is all you can
49:57
configure in the auto attendant you can't Define any custom menu options and there's only one menu this one if you
50:04
want to choice for Spanish speaking callers you're out of luck if you want a choice for what's your website and email
50:10
address you're out of luck and if you want to define a whole bunch of options that actually go to the same place you're out of luck and that sounds silly
50:17
but a lot of businesses want to have like sales support billing Etc and they
50:22
all actually go to the same person it just makes them look bigger than they actually are it's a common desire and
50:29
this system can't do it on top of that response points designers were so hyped about their voice recognition that
50:36
there's no option for touch tones you can't set these to option one option two Etc so if your caller can't speak clear
50:43
English their only choice is to say things the system doesn't recognize over and over until it punts them to the
50:48
operator assuming you even set one up this is pretty weak stuff but again I do
Voice recognition features
50:54
have to give them credit for the voice recognition because it's surprisingly good for its era I kept using the name
51:00
bobson dougnut earlier that is actually what I set this phone to now that's a pretty weird name uh I got it from a
51:07
silly uh Super Nintendo game with a very poor translation but if you know the party you'd like to
51:14
reach just say their name otherwise say operator bobson dougnut transferring
51:21
to the system can in fact handle that which is pretty impressive
51:27
here's the thing though uh let's uh call in again Bob transferring
51:34
to it got it that time God damn it I tested that a dozen times at home and it
51:41
never got it I was going to tell you that the speech recognition might be pretty good but it you know it doesn't
51:46
understand abbreviations or nicknames and so if you do have somebody with an odd name you have to come in here and give them a nickname so that it can uh
51:53
match to that but I guess I was just slurring my words because I just tried
51:58
it like three times and it worked every time so um yeah okay I got to give him even more props than I intended now of
52:05
course that is a pretty common abbreviation for a common American name uh but shockingly or perhaps not so much
52:12
this system actually does pretty well with nonwestern names but I think we can guess why that
52:18
is otherwise say operator zong hang transferring toong Wang
52:28
yeah so is it any surprise that the uh Project Lead made sure this system could handle his name probably not so much but
52:35
still got to give them props for it so while this is pretty impressive for a
52:40
cheap PBX from 2007 none of that was actually the product's focus apparently
52:46
the bulk of the natural language features are not aimed at external callar they're actually intended for
52:52
internal users so we need to take a look at that a huge focus in the design of the response point system was this huge
52:59
blue button here this is sort of like the um the start button for respon point so if I hit this I get a
53:07
prompt call
53:12
Bob and it calls Bob uh or how about this one I'll call in from
53:21
outside okay so Steve answers and now he wants to send this call over to Bob so
53:27
call one parked transfer to Bob B transferring you may now hang
53:38
up slick right I could also do this call
53:44
one parked transfer to Bob's voicemail voicemail for Bob transferring
53:52
you may now hang up and of course if I'm not on a call I could ask to intercom or paage him paig
54:01
Bob oh this will have a lot of feedback okay that was a bad idea now
54:07
there are buttons on my phone to do some of these things I think um I think that's last call return that's my call
54:13
history that's a conference um this is transfer I believe uh but there isn't
54:18
one on here for page or intercom um certainly not one for transfer to voicemail um and the point is that the
54:25
voice feature means I don't need to remember which of these esoteric icons represents what and I also don't need to
54:31
remember his extension number so for someone who's bad with this sort of thing it's a fantastic feature at least
54:38
in concept but at this point we run into more problems and this time they aren't
54:43
nitpicks as I said response Point has some neat features but it struggles with
54:48
fundamentals so for instance let's call in again okay so we're on our call and we're talking and now I need to step
54:55
away from the phone and do something so I'm going to put you on hold all right the uh hold button lights
55:01
up and uh I'm going to go in the back room and just do some stuff I'm in the back room right now all
55:09
right I've had you on hold for about 2 minutes 50 seconds or so so any moment
55:15
now that happens uh my phone starts ringing to remind me that I have a call on hold this is a great feature most
55:22
pbxs have it it's called um hold reminder hold recall something like that uh but let's let this uh ring for about
55:29
a minute or so cuz I'm not here I'm in the back room checking on something so it just keeps
55:34
ringing it's been about uh 45 55
55:42
seconds all right there we go and it uh quits ringing that's pretty typical you don't want your phone just ring
55:48
continuously you know for the whole 20 minutes or in the back room or whatever so hold reminder usually just rings for
55:53
a minute or so and then it um stops and another 5 minutes or so it starts ringing again um but um there's a
56:01
problem here because my phone kind of doesn't seem to have a held call anymore
56:08
and my polycom doesn't show a call in progress because it just hung up on
The hold problem, and why Response Point doesn't work
56:17
me okay okay okay okay so this is a very common failure mode
56:23
for misconfigured Voiceover IP systems um happen s all the time when you have your network set up wrong but that's not
56:29
what's going on here because this is actually by Design the help file says outright that it's supposed to work like
56:36
this and with that response Point goes in the garbage full stop no discussion
56:41
it's over there is no valid use for this system do you remember the part earlier
56:47
where I said that programmers can't make phone systems this is what I was talking about you can imagine justifications
56:53
that they came up with for this Behavior but they're all wrong they're all in the real world people who
56:58
actually have to use phones for their job know that holds can last 15 minutes
57:04
30 minutes longer you know if you're a warehouse worker who has to go move a bunch of crates to figure out
57:09
something's in stock you you just got to leave the collar on hold for as long as it takes and 3 minutes isn't enough it
57:16
can't be adjusted at least not that I could find the help file didn't say anything about it but even if it could like this feature shouldn't exist there
57:23
is no purpose for it there's no people X crime no phone sin more Cardinal than
57:29
dropping a held call this is a never event this cannot be permitted if if you
57:34
are a phone system vendor and your system does this your customer will call you and say they're dropping you or suing you unless you can fix it in less
57:41
than 24 hours now there's several reasons that this is so dire and the first one is that all customers
57:48
everywhere forever believe that a person they're talking to on the phone is a victim who has been trapped on a call
57:55
with them and will th weasel their way out by any means necessary customers hate being put on hold because they
58:01
believe that is just a means to justify hanging up on them and if this actually happens there is no force on Earth that
58:08
will convince them it was an accident and they will go on to repeat this tale of woe to anyone who will listen and in
58:15
every online review space that they can find for years this is devastating to a business's
58:23
reputation you cannot drop calls Beyond how immensely rude it is if someone gets
58:29
disconnected they then have to work their way back to you if they called in through a receptionist or a hunt group
58:35
they may have been dropped on you randomly and they won't necessarily know your name on top of that at a lot of
58:40
places employees aren't supposed to blindly transfer calls to other people even if you do know their names so it
58:46
might take half an hour for you to get back in touch it might be impossible I will stake my name on the promise that
58:53
no PBX in history has this option because it's gibberish I mean there are
58:59
many options for held calls um some systems will let you uh redirect calls that are on hold for too long to an
59:05
inbound call Que for instance great feature but no PBX designer would add an
59:11
option that just drops the call it's it's
59:18
incomprehensible why would you do this I would ask what's wrong with them why would someone do this but I already know
59:24
the answer it's because response Point wasn't made by PBX people it was made by programmers and worse programmers
59:31
working at Microsoft in the mid 2000s one of the most cloistered environments imaginable I think it's safe to say that
59:38
most programmers statistically speaking have never held jobs outside of offices except maybe briefly as teenagers so
59:44
they don't use phones that often and not even as much as other people in the same building like sales or customer support
59:50
So when a programmer attempts to design a phone system something which happens depressingly often the resulting mess is
59:58
at best fit to the needs of someone who works in an office and only uses the phone to briefly get in touch with
1:00:03
people to make plans or make brief requests or to join conference calls they don't want to be on that's it that
1:00:11
person and I'm sorry if this is you but I'm I'm just saying you can't from that
1:00:17
perspective understand the vastly different needs of a call center agent and you certainly won't understand the
1:00:23
guy who owns a pharmacy in Kansas and that's not not a flippant example okay it's not a joke I keep saying that
1:00:29
because in my career I kept working with these people I talked to at least 40 mom
1:00:34
and pop pharmacies so they're pretty much my model for a true small business
1:00:39
and for that purpose this system is utterly unacceptable if you're running an independent drugstore here's what you
1:00:45
want to happen when someone calls your published number all the phones in the building Ring until someone picks up
1:00:51
except maybe the one back in the manager's office now you might want the call to get forwarded to voic if nobody
1:00:56
answers after a while but a lot of the time you just want it to ring indefinitely now that call will get answered eventually by whoever's nearest
1:01:03
the phone maybe that's the pharmacist maybe it's a stock boy who knows whatever the caller wants a prescription
1:01:08
a stock check whatever whoever grabbed it has to deal with it so if that person's at the front counter and they
1:01:14
need to go to the back room to answer their question they need to be able to look at the phone and see that their
1:01:20
call came in on line two there'll be a little yellow light on next to a button labeled line two so they hit hold and
1:01:26
that light starts blinking the employee Now deals with one or two other customers waiting in line and when
1:01:31
they're ready they walk to the back room they find out whatever they need to find out then they pick up the nearest phone
1:01:37
whichever one it is and they press line two to retrieve their call they give the answer and if the caller now needs to
1:01:42
talk to someone else they're going to hit hold again and then turn and yell Bob pick up line two this is how things
1:01:49
have worked at small retail businesses at warehouses at factories and countless other places for decades partly because
1:01:57
it has very good ergonomics this fits the needs of a small business really well and it's very easy to learn but
1:02:04
also largely because it's how the AT&T 1A and 1 A2 Key Systems worked in the
1:02:09
1940s and 60s respectively those things were incredibly popular so Decades of pbxs have had the option to mimic them
1:02:16
and that's kept the technique in cultural circulation even most voice over IP pbxs are capable of simulating a
1:02:22
fixed pool of outside lines so you can do this hold and retrieve thing even if
1:02:27
it's a total fiction it fits this workflow so you have to be able to do it
1:02:33
this phone right here can do that response Point can't and that's a crucial Miss in my opinion the most
1:02:40
underserved businesses in this space are tiny establishments that are open to the public and I think Microsoft should have
1:02:46
focused on those but they didn't and I'm not surprised because again only a tiny
1:02:52
percentage of programmers have ever worked retail and those who have usually think of it as a Cess pit that they
1:02:57
escaped as a natural part of growing up rather than a massive industry full of people with needs that aren't being met
1:03:05
but what else is new I'm not the first person to say that software companies are Ivory Towers at any rate this system
1:03:11
is totally useless for that kind of venue it would admittedly work fairly well at a law office for instance that
1:03:19
an insurance office that sort of thing where everyone sits at the same desk every day uh where most callers are
1:03:24
trying to reach one particular person most calls never get transferred and if a call drops both parties can usually
1:03:30
get back in touch quickly and they probably have a good rapport there's no suspicion no distrust and that is a
1:03:37
market to be sure I worked with plenty of businesses like that but I think most
1:03:42
of those places have the budget to hire a phone tech at least as a consultant to get it set up and they're way too busy
1:03:49
actually working if you will to wear another hat like that they're also frequently staffed by people who do not
1:03:55
not like adapting to new ideas you cannot get a lawyer to configure a phone For Love or Money let me tell you so the
1:04:02
one Niche where response Point could work isn't one where it could Thrive and
1:04:07
I question whether it could even function there to be honest the inability to place calls on hold for
1:04:13
long periods is an incomprehensible limitation even for a lawyer 3 minutes
1:04:19
isn't enough for any employee of any business and mandatory recall isn't
1:04:25
acceptable most people hate that feature and will turn it off if they have the choice and what's even worse is that the
1:04:31
response Point manual is both misleading and kind of smug about this the manual
1:04:37
says that holds timeout after 2 minutes which is wrong it's actually 4 uh so I'm guessing they got Mass complaints and
1:04:43
their solution was just bump the timer up by 1 minute yeah that'll fix it so anyway they forgot to update the docs
1:04:50
whatever but it goes on to say in typical programmer talking down to you in a bug report fashion that your real
1:04:57
problem is that you shouldn't have wanted to do that you should have used a park instead okay okay so most pbxs have a
1:05:05
feature called parking and it's kind of like an enhanced hold it's like this I'm going to call in again so my Call's in
1:05:11
progress now if I hit the big blue button call one parked it's now parked so my phone is
1:05:19
completely idle I could place another call if I wanted Etc or I could go over to another phone
1:05:28
retrieve call retrieving call one and pull the call over to this set
1:05:36
so that means I can go to any phone in the office and pick up where I left off without needing to send the call there
1:05:42
with a transfer this is a great feature this is a great feature every
1:05:47
system should have it most do and I suspect that the developers thought this solved the problem even for pops
1:05:54
Pharmacy you know who needs line Keys just go to the back and retrieve the call from the
1:06:02
park okay so people who are not computer people
1:06:08
don't get abstract Concepts like this and I hate to speak in generalities but I've been around the block and I can
1:06:14
tell you that the fundamental unifying quality of every complaint by every nerd about normies or losers going back
1:06:22
decades comes down to one fact many people do not grock Concepts that have
1:06:28
no tangible form you and I being computer nerds easily conceive that a computer which of course a VoIP phone or
1:06:35
a PBX is uh contain invisible logical spaces in which information and virtual
1:06:41
objects can be stored and retrieved and we model these spaces in our heads we mirror the computer's internal State and
1:06:47
that allows us to plan our interactions with it what I'm saying is that observationally I can tell you that non-
1:06:53
nerds are not used to this Stu style of thinking and it's very hard to get the manager of a feed store to play ball
1:06:59
with it when they put a call on hold and a button starts blinking that's physical tangible material it's effortless to
1:07:07
understand when you have them Park a call it disappears into this intangible
1:07:12
imaginary slot and you're asking them to imagine that virtual parking place in their head and then retrieve their call
1:07:18
from it with arbitrary unrelated actions and they won't do it just trust me they
1:07:24
never will they're just too busy doing their jobs to remember all this silly I mean this is actually better
1:07:30
than most systems on a typical PBX you park a call by hitting a park button if you're lucky but often uh you have to
1:07:37
wait for the system to tell you which slot it parked it in and then you retrieve it by dialing some insufferable
1:07:43
key sequence like Star 81 followed by the slot number so the the owner of the
1:07:49
pharmacy is standing at the counter he's got six different prescriptions rattling around in his head there's eight customers in line one's on their cell
1:07:55
phone yelling at their doctor's office there's a baby screaming there's two calls on hold and you want them to hear
1:08:00
George pick up Park 2 and convert that into lift the phone and dial Star 812
1:08:07
pound no they're not doing it you wouldn't even want to do that then you
1:08:12
add in the response Point philosophy and now you've got this 65-year-old pharmacist with his hand cued around the
1:08:17
handset mumbling as loudly as he can retrieve Park 2 cancel retrieve Park 2
1:08:24
it's voicemail it's just not happening and yet response Point thinks
1:08:30
this is the only way you should put anyone on hold remember that earlier I said there's a setting for Park music
1:08:36
but no hold music that's right uh I don't know if you noticed earlier but when I put this phone on hold it was
1:08:43
just dead silence oh boy no other PBX does this
1:08:48
and I have no idea what they were thinking it seems almost punitive oh you're not going to use our parks that
1:08:54
we're so proud of fine then enjoy your broken garbage feature loser the real
1:09:00
irony of all this is that the documentation implies that Parks solve the timeout problem they don't the timer
1:09:07
is still there it still recalls after 3 minutes except now if you don't pick up after your phone's been ringing for a
1:09:12
minute which by the way the customer can hear on their end they they're just sitting there listening to whole music
1:09:17
and suddenly they hear ring back so they know something's wrong once it runs out of recall time it then follows your
1:09:24
users no answer settings so instead of hanging up it dumps them to your voicemail this is worse than dropping
1:09:32
the call because the customer can absolutely tell that they just got mishandled it's it is
1:09:39
incredibly embarrassing and response point is full of issues like this where they obviously
1:09:45
either didn't know what they should have been aiming for or they tried to aim simpler and went too far the the whole
1:09:52
business uh for instance with assigning multiple users to one phone that that's a great feature when it works correctly
1:09:57
but the fact that these phones don't have line Keys renders it counterproductive at best now in a real
1:10:04
PBX there are multiple features that would have been better fits for these specific telephone sets but I'd guess
1:10:11
that Microsoft designers not knowing how users work thought they were picking the simpler option not realizing it was
1:10:18
actually more confusing so okay I'd like to move on to
PC application
1:10:24
a big conclusion but I'd be remiss in not mentioning the final component of the system I couldn't figure out where
1:10:29
else to put it in the script so we're just going to do it now besides the administrator there's a second piece of software you can install called the
1:10:35
response Point assistant uh now most modern pbxs have something like this and
1:10:40
it's a kind of computer telephony integration though not nearly as advanced as the call center screen pop I
1:10:47
mentioned earlier any user can use this you just uh put in your extension uh put in your password it autois discovers the
1:10:53
base station fortunately and then we get a list of all the users on the system uh so this is a presence
1:11:00
dialogue which means that it shows you whether people are on a call or not so Steve answers a call and he turns
1:11:07
red in the list now I tried this out earlier and I had to change which user I
1:11:13
was logged into and I'll show you why let's log out then log back in as Steve
1:11:20
so now we can see the status of Bob's phone and the incoming users job rooll that I created earlier when we were
1:11:26
messing with inbound calls watch this transferring
1:11:31
to all right so Bob answers the phone and both him and the incoming users job
1:11:37
roll turn red because even though incoming users didn't answer the call a
1:11:42
phone to which that user is assigned is
1:11:49
busy this is so broken I I don't have words this means
1:11:56
that if Steve was monitoring Bob's line because he's the boss and he's the secretary if Steve answers a call Bob's
1:12:04
phone will look like it's busy to everybody else in the company this doesn't work this is just
1:12:10
fundamentally broken but whatever let's press on so besides seeing everybody's
1:12:16
presence you can also double click on any user to call
1:12:21
them and that automatically picks up on the speaker phone dials the number and then you can pick up the handset if you
1:12:27
want this is a nice feature and I can't prove this but I would guess that this
1:12:32
also has a plugin for handling tell URLs and what that means is if you're on a
1:12:37
website in your browser and you see a phone number usually it will become a clickable link and if you click on it uh
1:12:43
this app will forward it to your phone so you don't have to go manually dial it nice feature and since Microsoft added
1:12:49
those apis to Windows in like 1995 I'd be shocked if this didn't have it we can also add custom contacts to this uh you
1:12:56
can see I've added my external uh VI phone here so if I uh double click
1:13:01
that it calls it directly terrific so far this is nice but one curious thing
1:13:07
is there's no field to just dial a number directly in the app I mean most of these programs have that so you can
1:13:14
just dial a number on your keyboard and hit enter uh they have to be added as a contact for that to work that's a weird
1:13:20
limitation if you ask me but what's even weirder is that there's no voicemail implement ation I mean there's an option
1:13:26
here to call voicemail but all that does to voicemail please enter your password
1:13:32
to check voicemail for a different extension press star is make your phone call voicemail the same as if you
1:13:38
pressed the button on the phone and that means you're going to have to use the miserable touchtone interface you know
1:13:45
uh press seven to delete a message press nine to keep a message users hate
1:13:51
voicemail and this was a golden opportunity to improve that process remember earlier when I showed you uh
1:13:57
how you could record messages using the software on your PC in conjunction with your phone that would have been amazing
1:14:05
for voicemail I mean being able to play or download messages on your PC would be fantastic being able to delete them on
1:14:12
mass would be amazing but just a set of buttons for save message next message
1:14:18
previous message that alone would have made voicemail far more tolerable they
1:14:24
they missed every ramp off this freeway it's like an inverse hat
1:14:30
trick now on the flip side sort of it does improve the call Park process so
1:14:37
let's talk more about how much that sucks let me put another call on Park okay so I parked a call on this phone
1:14:44
you can't tell right there's no indication that there was ever a call on this phone the only way to find out is
1:14:50
uh to press the big blue button call one part and that gives you a reminder that
1:14:56
there's a call parked but if I do it on this phone there's no such reminder so if
1:15:04
Steve Stacks up eight parked calls even though they could be retrieved by anybody else in the company there's no
1:15:10
way for anyone else to tell that they exist he would have to tell them I have a park in slot seven because there's
1:15:16
eight Park slots in this machine and then they can pick up their phone and say retrieve slot 7 uh but they have to
1:15:21
know it's there they have no idea who's parked there's no way to find out the details of those calls and for that
1:15:27
matter when someone Parks a call call one parked it just tells them call One Call
1:15:34
two call three parked and they just have to remember which one it was you can obviously lose track so in the assistant
1:15:41
app if we go to parked calls this shows every Park in the system and if you hover over them it says who parked it
1:15:47
and when the call came in and if you click it it will retrieve it to your phone this makes it a lot easier to not
1:15:53
lose a call on the other hand you can't park an ongoing call from the window so
1:15:58
you have to do it from the phone and I I didn't mention this yet but the phone interfaces is kind of broken U you may
1:16:04
have noticed that I'm not pressing a special Park button I'm just hitting the
1:16:09
big blue button it it just Parks any call you have in progress automatically whether you want it or not so that kind
1:16:15
of sucks but pay attention to this call one parked retrieve
1:16:23
call retrieving call one okay retrieving call one hey how's
1:16:28
it going oh I see it didn't actually
1:16:35
connect the call to my phone it's actually ringing right now and if I hang up that ring comes through this is the
1:16:41
call that was just retrieved you have to hang up and then pick up again to actually answer it it doesn't
1:16:47
automatically end the I can feel the vein in my brain
1:16:54
about to burst and on top of that and this is the wild thing we park a call
1:17:00
then we retrieve it from the app retrieving call
1:17:07
one this two leaves us connected to a dead call with the voice system and we
1:17:15
have to hang up and pick up again to actually answer the call what this is just unfinished how
1:17:24
did they sell this ah so at this point you could tell I'm giving this thing a
1:17:30
zero star review but we we do have to just finish the last little bit because there's still
1:17:36
actually one more horrible feature first however a good one if we go to the
1:17:41
settings menu and we go to identification this is the only system I've ever seen that actually solves for
1:17:47
this problem a user can edit their own contact details now obviously in a large
1:17:52
business this would be absolutely out of the question it's a massive security risk and it makes sense that most systems would just not promise this so
1:18:00
that they don't have to explain why they're blocking everyone from using it cuz obviously you don't want to hire
1:18:05
some nobody who you know comes in sits down on the first day finds out they can do this and just changes their name to
1:18:11
the CEO of the company and then starts calling random extensions and telling people to buy gift cards but at a small
1:18:18
business you know if there's two people in an elevator and someone farts everybody knows who did it right so
1:18:24
there's not much risk cuz someone masquerading as another employee on the other hand when the receptionist gets
1:18:29
married she doesn't need to wait for her name to get updated for 6 weeks because the boss is out of town he's the only
1:18:35
one who has an admin login you know she can just do it herself so this is a great feature the other two tabs here
1:18:41
are just uh the same ones that we saw in uh the admin panel so users can basically control all of their own
1:18:46
settings that is probably a good thing uh there's also a new tab for notifications so uh if I make an inbound
1:18:53
call you see there's this little um uh people call it a toast now that tells me there's an inbound call however I can't
1:19:01
I can't answer it you'd think I could just tell it to make my phone pick up on the speaker but I can't uh and if I hit
1:19:07
the X here it doesn't actually drop the call it just hides it so it's kind of useless but uh if you don't like it you
1:19:13
can at least turn it off and then finally we've got the contact page so this is where you could put in um all
1:19:19
your users so you could do click the dial and that in itself would be fine in fact it's a pretty pretty well
1:19:25
implemented feature it allows you to have uh a name and then three different numbers you can actually set it up so
1:19:31
that if you do have multiple voice services like analog lines plus viip trunks or like um one viip service for
1:19:38
local calls and one for international you could actually set it up to use one particular service for this specific
1:19:44
contact which hey I mean at least they have some way of doing that and you can add 1,00 contacts per user so this seems
1:19:53
great but there's a feature here which I have to call a Mis feature it's called
1:19:59
bypass receptionist and here's what it does suppos that Bob the CEO doesn't
1:20:05
want all of his friends and Associates to have to wait for the automated receptionist to transfer them every time they call in um especially because his
1:20:11
user is hidden in the public directory so they'll have to talk to the real receptionist every single time well he
1:20:17
can add all those people to this list and enable the bypass receptionist feature and now when they call in
1:20:24
transferring to they just get passed through straight
1:20:31
to his phone fantastic nobody has to pass go except this works whether Bob is
1:20:38
in the office or not many PBX systems have a do not disturb feature uh that a user can set on their phone or they can
1:20:45
enable call forwarding and and many other things uh to handle being out of the office for an extended period but
1:20:51
this system doesn't so Bob leaves on vacation lock his office door and now
1:20:56
every single person that he knows is unable to reach the business at all because they call the main number or any
1:21:02
of the other numbers and they just get his voicemail every time so nobody else
1:21:07
even knows that they're trying to call agonizing and there are workarounds
1:21:13
um you can go into the admin panel and you can disable receptionist bypass but
1:21:18
you can't do it on a per entry basis so you have to turn it off for the entire
1:21:24
company at once there's no way for the admin to go into a specific user and
1:21:29
remove those entries so they would have to go in reset their password log in through the assistant app and then
1:21:35
uncheck all those entries themselves and then when Bob gets back he has to go turn them all back
1:21:41
on the aneurysm I can feel it it's happening this this is an attractive
1:21:47
nuisance it seems like a neat feature but the real solution is direct inward dials so that Bob can have a direct
1:21:54
number to give to all his friends and then another one that calls the front desk now of course you can't always have
1:22:01
that if you just have analog lines or you don't know how to set up a direct inward dial but uh this is just a case
1:22:07
where you just need to do it correctly because doing it this way is a bad idea I could continue complaining and
Response Point's decline and demise
1:22:15
inventing stories about why this thing sucked but really the proofs in the pudding response point was never a major
1:22:21
player and when Microsoft discontinued it just 3 years later the Articles all basically said yeah it's about time I
1:22:29
doubt many end users loved this and I'm sure PBX Tex hated it they did sell a
1:22:34
bunch though um I found this one at repc our local eway store it just showed up one week and the phones were also there
1:22:41
except they'd been sitting on a shelf for 5 years so they must have sold if people are still throwing them out uh
1:22:48
there's also several units on eBay so none of these are unobtanium but on the other hand they're rare enough that
1:22:53
nobody has arived any of the software that made it incredibly difficult to get this working let me tell you this thing
1:22:59
is totally useless without the administrator software there's no local interface no web UI nothing if you lose
1:23:06
the program you're just screwed you can't operate it and the only place it was ever distributed was on the original
1:23:12
CD ROM that came with the device which of course nobody kept on the other hand
1:23:17
Microsoft did release two service packs and after several days of searching I managed to turn up the SP2 installer on
1:23:24
an FTP run by dink's Australian division I'm guessing nobody else bothered
1:23:30
mirroring it because Microsoft hosted it on their site for free who would pay for the bandwidth if they could just link to
1:23:35
Microsoft's extremely fast site on the other hand Microsoft probably didn't have an Australian mirror so dink had to
1:23:42
host it locally for their customers to get tolerable speeds so okay of course even after I got that um I then
1:23:48
discovered the software on the PBX was newer than the pack I downloaded and there's no way to downgrade it or to
1:23:54
find the later software and you can't use an older version of the admin app with a newer version of the software so
1:24:00
I I had to disassemble the PBX I had to pull the hard drive out I had to figure out how to inject the older version of
1:24:06
the software which is all very fun stuff but hang on let's let's go back a sec
Third parties
1:24:11
dlink what are they doing here wasn't this a Microsoft product
1:24:17
well this is where really gets absurd Microsoft never built a response
1:24:23
Point PBX to despite this godforsaken thing looking like an Xbox 360 prototype they had nothing to do with its creation
1:24:30
this thing was actually made under the uh sis Pine brand I have no idea what
1:24:36
that word means uh and it only exists on paper anyway it's actually a submark of quanta makers of a vast range of
1:24:43
computing products including my home Nas uh but there were also units made by a asra and dlink and initially unidan was
1:24:51
even going to get in on the fun but that fell through for some reason and um I don't have the dlink unit but I do have
1:24:58
an A Astra thanks to a viewer shout outs to Matt thank you for sending this over and I have a dlink phone so I can show
1:25:05
you a few of the differences if you're curious uh the phones are of course completely
1:25:11
intercompatibility
1:25:24
these companies were already selling uh that just got new firmware that's usually how it goes in this market uh in
1:25:30
addition I know for a fact that when response Point collapsed a Astra published firmware to convert all their
1:25:36
phones into generic zp devices so I suspect I have some of the only working response Point desk sets left in the
1:25:42
world they all have basically the same features but not the same layout at all for instance the CIS Pine uses these
1:25:48
inscrutable icons uh while the dlink uses actual uh text labels which have their Pros cons but I can never remember
1:25:56
what the hell any of these mean so you know what my opinion is on the matter the dlink also has a built-in menu this
1:26:03
thing doesn't have any configuration menu whatsoever but this isn't necessarily a good thing because uh this
1:26:09
has a whole bunch of options in here like um for instance um call forwarding when you're busy or at all times or if
1:26:16
you don't answer after several Rings Anonymous call rejection none none of this works there's no features for this
1:26:23
in response point so these just don't do anything um that makes me think that this was intended for another system and
1:26:29
they just put in a very minimal effort to convert it again very common the biggest difference though is the big
1:26:35
blue button or lack thereof the Microsoft folks made a big deal out of this in the concept of the system they
1:26:42
called it a Cornerstone of the design but dlink either didn't get the message or didn't care their um teal button here
1:26:49
looks like just some generic feature access key that they repurposed on the other hand though they they had another
1:26:54
model the dph 128 Ms on which the RP button was blue so what do I know it's
1:27:02
still not any bigger though and um there's problems with the manual for
1:27:07
instance it claims the phone has functioning line keys that would be a great Improvement if you could actually bind each user to a separate physical
1:27:13
key but I don't think those actually work it's pretty obvious this manual isn't for this phone response point is
1:27:21
mentioned on the first couple pages and there's a couple pages that show how to add the phone to the system and then the
1:27:26
rest of it is all clearly generic documentation um it all refers to the
1:27:32
SIP server instead of mentioning response Point ever again uh they also talk about tons and tons of settings
1:27:38
that would never work on this system and in fact that whole section like page 20
1:27:44
out of 200 starts out with a warning to not change any of this stuff because it'll break response Point That's how
1:27:51
little effort dlink put into this product if they been awake enough to even realize what they were selling they
1:27:57
would have removed all of this documentation and disabled most of the menus response Point phones are supposed
1:28:03
to be centrally configured so all this is unnecessary nonsense but dlink didn't care because they were sleepwalking and
1:28:10
who can blame them Microsoft made a hash of this entire product and it's because
1:28:16
they didn't take the Reigns in any way they didn't bother making anything themselves they just partnered with
1:28:21
other companies but it was just whoever would have them they didn't go out and select existing industry juggernauts or
1:28:28
upand comers they just offered this to whoever felt like throwing a few bucks at an idea on a whim so to no one's
1:28:35
shock these companies didn't put forth their best efforts and I'm sure that all of them had other plates spinning they
1:28:41
weren't going to commit hard to this Venture when they had their own vo products they were trying to get off the ground and it wasn't their job to this
1:28:47
was Microsoft's baby it was their business to put response points best foot forward but they didn't bother
1:28:54
controlling anything so that didn't happen I mean I don't have the response Point specs I don't know what these
1:29:00
companies were given as far as instructions but it's pretty clear that Microsoft placed no requirements on the
1:29:06
hardware at all I mean if we just look at these two base units and compare their design it's pretty obvious that
1:29:13
Microsoft didn't give them any guidance whatsoever in what they should be building for instance the CIS Pine is
1:29:19
absolutely enormous it's like the size of an original Xbox and it kind of has you know the three 60 design language
1:29:25
going on you know with the the white and the gray and a lot of other Microsoft Hardware sort of had these colors so you
1:29:31
might think that they gave them a palette to work with but then you look at the aastra and it's just
1:29:37
um silver paint black plastic it's the most boring thing you've ever seen in your life the dlink product on the other
1:29:44
hand at least from pictures I've never been able to actually find one looks much smaller and it's designed more like
1:29:50
a desktop KVM switch from like 2004 so completely different Vibes to their
1:29:56
whole industrial design but that is just Aesthetics right let's talk about function the A asra and the dlink have
The bizarre Syspine
1:30:03
no local interface whatsoever because of course as I showed you response point is meant to be used solely over your
1:30:10
network so why then does the CIS Pine have a local interface I'm sure
1:30:16
Microsoft didn't give any specifications for that uh and indeed I don't think Quant knew what to do with it if we uh
1:30:24
plug this thing in all right we get this start booting message and in my experience nine times
1:30:31
out of 10 this will just sit there it'll never get off the uh start booting message but when it does it just
1:30:36
switches to like uh system ready and that's the only message that it will ever appear on this panel it doesn't do
1:30:42
anything else it doesn't tell you uh whether calls are in progress it doesn't tell you if the there's a network service Interruption it says absolutely
1:30:49
nothing once this thing is booted yeah this is actually passing
1:30:54
calls right now but all it'll say is start booting and you see all these controls over here you think oh cool
1:31:00
I'll be able to do like Diagnostics without having to get into the the administrator app no none of this does
1:31:06
anything I think if you press IP sometimes it'll show you the thing's
1:31:11
IP address yeah but I think you have to get to the uh system ready uh part before it'll do that so whatever
1:31:18
microcontroller on here is handling the screen uh is failing to communicate reliably with the software running on it
1:31:24
and the fact that it happens like 9 out of 10 times means that there's some race condition that's governed by how warm
1:31:32
the thing is or who knows what and the only other feature here is this reset
1:31:37
button which simply doesn't do what it says it does what this actually
1:31:42
supposedly does is shut down the system and to do that you have to press and
1:31:47
hold it and after 5 Seconds the screen will say
1:31:54
unplug power cord here's the problem I am 100% positive that this isn't
1:32:02
actually talking to the underlying system that this is just the microcontroller driving the screen
1:32:07
that's been hardcoded to display this message after 5 seconds because naturally this is a PC running Windows
1:32:14
XP and there's no way it could have shut down in 5 seconds and we'll come back to
1:32:20
that point but anyway this screen appears to be fake it appears to be a decoy either
1:32:26
something they intended to do more with later or and I think this is far more likely this is something that they made
1:32:32
for some other purpose they invested the R&D in this thing uh to make their own
1:32:37
PBX and then they did a really half ass job of uh making it run response point I
1:32:43
mean there's no way they would have put in this much effort just for Microsoft's weird half-ass project that was
1:32:49
obviously not going anywhere if you're wondering what I'm talking about have you noticed this butt button next to the
1:32:54
screen this is a release that allows you to take the entire screen out and flip
1:33:00
it over and reinstall it because it actually connects to the PCB with Pogo pins and it has two identical sets of
1:33:08
pads so we can now put this back in like that now why would you do that because
1:33:15
this machine can be installed in two different configurations you can either just put it on a shelf or a desk or you
1:33:22
can put it on a wall using these teardrop hangers on the back but obviously you wouldn't want the screen
1:33:27
at the bottom so you'd have to flip it over to do that and then the screen would be upside down so they added this
1:33:32
neat mechanism so you can flip the screen over that's absolutely amazing
1:33:38
and absurdly over-engineered especially for a product that wasn't their baby so that's why we know they didn't do this
1:33:44
for Microsoft now going back to the PC part uh if we take a look at the back of this thing it sure doesn't look like a
1:33:52
PC cuz we don't have any of the ual ports there's a couple USBS but otherwise we just have uh Lan um we've
1:33:58
got audio for the music on hold and then we've got the uh analog line modules oh and I have to mention the USB ports
1:34:05
they're fascinating uh those are how you factory reset the device there's there's no pin hole on here nothing like that uh
1:34:12
there's no option in the admin software to reset the device if you lose the password or something like that you have
1:34:18
to get the original CD and copy an exe off of it onto a flash drive then you
1:34:24
insert it you reboot the thing and you just um wait a long time because there's no way to tell if it executed it or not
1:34:31
and then once you think that maybe it worked you unplug the drive and then try to
1:34:36
reconnect very very professional the same thing uh if you just want to reset the password there's another exe uh
1:34:43
that's just called like reset response Point password you put it in here you just wait for a long time and naturally
1:34:48
both of these are lost forever so I don't even know if they work at all anyway the the point is it's it's
1:34:55
oversized it's over rot it's over engineered and it's obviously not for this purpose but it is clearly an
1:35:02
appliance now let's look at the aastra okay on the front we've got um
The boring AAstra
1:35:08
well it it kind of looks like a crappy DVR or uh like a pennium 3 small form
1:35:13
factor PC and that's pretty much what it is because yeah that's obviously just a
1:35:19
PC and one that wasn't customized for this purpose at all we've got a PS2 keyboard and mouse ports we've got a
1:35:25
local uh VGA interface way too many USBS it's got a headphone jack why would you
1:35:31
need a headphone jack on a PBX because this isn't meant to be a PBX I'm sure
1:35:37
they just bought this from some odm that was selling it as a generic set top box or whatever uh and indeed if we open it
1:35:43
up we find exactly what you'd expect from that this comes apart with a single
1:35:48
screw the uh CIS Bine by the way goes to Great Links to hide every single fast on
1:35:53
the whole device they're all uh either under feet um there's some hidden under here uh it's really designed to look
1:35:59
seamless this is designed to um be a computer this is a pretty
1:36:06
typical little guy we've got a a stick of ddr2 here um we've got a a discon
1:36:12
module over here that's the hard drive uh there's actually a a normal front panel header over here we've got USB
1:36:18
headers there's a via South Bridge I'm sure there's a North Bridge Under this heat sink uh and under that heat sink
1:36:24
we've got a via Eden CPU it's a very common chip for embedded applications for the Intel atom came along but what
1:36:31
we have more than anything is an awful lot of empty space there's just um
1:36:37
really nothing in here and you know based on what we can see of a dinks offering that's probably just an
1:36:42
off-the-shelf Mini ITX board in a plastic box so to no one's surprise all
1:36:48
these things are just generic PCS cheap designs that nobody cared about the most interesting one is definitely the CIS
1:36:54
Pine but um I'll leave that for a follow-up video cuz it's honestly so weird inside that I want to spend a bit
1:37:00
more time on it the the point is though being PCS with Microsoft software it is
1:37:06
not shocking at all that these run Windows XP each one of these has a COA
1:37:11
on the bottom and it may say Microsoft response point but come on you know that's just Windows XP and if you don't
1:37:17
believe me let's just fire the thing up I mean it has a VGA port all right we got our keyboard and mouse
1:37:24
click all right here's our award bios and there's Windows XP boots incredibly
1:37:31
fast I've never seen any copy of Windows start up this quickly it's like 3 seconds and sure enough it's just a copy
1:37:38
of XP embedded it's not even Service Pack 3 I don't think that was out yet at any rate they have put absolutely
1:37:45
nothing in the desktop or in the start menu it's actually the most barebones copy of Windows I've ever seen check
1:37:51
this out that's it there's literally no programs
1:37:57
and there's no indication anywhere that this is an appliance you can't tell that
1:38:03
it's running any special software there's not even anything in the Cy tray other than a driver for the built-in
1:38:09
sound card oh and another one for the graphics you know whatever in fact the only way to find out that this isn't
1:38:15
just a blank freshly installed copy of Windows is to go into the control panel right right I forgot they removed
1:38:23
all those you have to manually go to the services control panel and then if you scroll
1:38:28
down there's a handful of services for response point this is the entire local
1:38:34
presence of the response Point software which of course makes sense I'm sure
1:38:40
Microsoft didn't expect anyone to expose the local desktop why would they this is clearly meant to be a headless product
1:38:47
but of course none of the vendors were paying attention they were all asleep so they just left the VGA port on there and
1:38:54
whatnot so users probably plugged these in when they got them and got very confused thinking they'd been sent a
1:39:00
machine that wasn't actually usable not realizing that there's no local admin software and about that that's a huge
1:39:07
Miss on Microsoft's part this is PC based you cannot make a PC that does not
1:39:12
have a video card yes I know you technically can shush at the point this was made it was virtually impossible to
1:39:19
get one that didn't have built-in Graphics they should have leveraged that they should have mandated a local console with the administrator software
1:39:26
installed so you don't need to run it on another machine if you don't want to it it would have cost them nothing and I
1:39:33
mean what was their solution if this thing fails to get a DHCP address or something what was their solution for
1:39:39
Diagnostics of any kind given that these clearly weren't required to even have a fault light or or a speaker to give you
1:39:46
a beep code if something goes wrong response point just feels completely unfinished it feels like they didn't
1:39:52
think through any of these problems but really honestly even that is putting the
Response Pointless
1:39:58
cart before the horse we need to be asking more fundamental questions about this like why do these exist at all I
1:40:05
don't mean response point pbxs I mean the physical embodiment thereof these um
1:40:11
little plastic boxes what do they achieve there's no specialized Hardware in this thing I mean yes the CIS Pine
1:40:19
does have its uh little analog interface cards uh but those were obviously op optional because these guys in dlink
1:40:25
didn't bother so they didn't have to either in fact I doubt Microsoft even asked them to these are probably just
1:40:30
those network attached converters I talked about earlier built into the box really quanta was just going above and
1:40:36
beyond and that means that per Microsoft specs uh the response Point base unit did not need to be anything other than
1:40:43
an ordinary PC so why isn't it one I mean obviously you require the special
1:40:49
phones they've got to have the big blue button but Microsoft could have had those made by anyone it would have cost
1:40:54
them next to nothing given their economies of scale the actual product that Microsoft delivered here response
1:41:00
Point itself is just a program that could be installed on any ordinary PC
1:41:06
and I admit I really wanted to do this as a bit for the video and I failed but I'm pretty sure that's just because the
1:41:13
software checks to see if it's running on XP embedded and whether it's using the enhanced right filter and I don't
1:41:18
have the chops to set those up but I also happen to know that the right filter is a nice bonus that's completely
1:41:24
unnecessary it's basically a Windows embedded feature that allows you to ensure that critical system files can't
1:41:30
be overwritten uh it's a really neat feature and there are tens of thousands of windows-based pbxs that have survived
1:41:37
just fine without it in fact one of the most common phone systems that I encountered in my career was 3cx which
1:41:44
was indeed a program you installed on Windows that was it just a program you
1:41:49
could put it on anything it was sold for about a decade and while it was was always maligned by serious phone people
1:41:56
it was still used successfully by thousands of companies I worked with a lot of them and they liked it it had its
1:42:02
problems but it sure did outperform response point and it didn't require any special Hardware so this whole thing
1:42:09
seems absurd Microsoft obviously could have sold response Point as a standalone product and it would have made a lot
1:42:14
more sense but even that isn't asking the real question which is why did
1:42:20
Microsoft make this at all and the to that I think is the story of the whole product they didn't want to make it
1:42:26
that's why it's so bad and that's why it was canceled I already pointed this out earlier but Mr hang was by all
1:42:32
appearances not passionate about phones and he didn't make this because Microsoft wanted to become a phone
1:42:38
company he made it cuz he needed a product the thing is though it's not that Microsoft was uninterested in being
1:42:44
a phone company they just already were way back at the beginning of this video which had to have been 2 hours ago I
1:42:51
mentioned Microsoft had a thing called office communication server I didn't mention that that already existed in
1:42:57
2007 before this product came out I did say however that it was much bigger in
1:43:02
scope than response point and that's the thing about Microsoft they don't do small when Redmond magazine a Microsoft
1:43:10
specific publication wrote an article about response points cancellation in 2010 they quoted a market research
1:43:16
company one that solely focuses on Microsoft products I should add who saw
1:43:22
two big problems s with it first it was in direct competition with office communication server which was a darling
1:43:28
of the company and it had far more proponents and contributed to the bottom line of multiple departments so that was
1:43:35
already never going to fly but also response point was focused on small businesses so it would have to have been
1:43:41
a rip roaring success moving hundreds of thousands to millions of units to even
1:43:46
show up on their balance sheet Microsoft cut it because they already had the thing they wanted the huge thing the a
1:43:53
prise thing now we could look at this and say wow maybe there shouldn't be businesses that are so big that even
1:43:59
when they come up with a really good idea they don't bother selling it if it won't make them billions in Revenue only
1:44:04
hundreds of millions that's true that's ridiculous but it's still not the real
1:44:10
issue here the real problem is that Microsoft was the wrong place to make this thing even from a capitalist
1:44:16
perspective for all of Mr Hong's blustering about creating a startup inside an Enterprise it didn't actually
1:44:22
work because Enterprises don't want startup products he would have been better off leaving and forming an actual
1:44:29
startup a PBX for the rest of us would have raak in capital in 2007 it was the
1:44:34
perfect year he had the perfect product all it needed was a little polishing but that couldn't happen at a company that
1:44:40
barely even bothers patching something if it doesn't show up profit within 18 months the truth is that response point
1:44:46
was Dead on Arrival and I think they knew that and didn't care because the only purpose of this in the first place
1:44:52
was to make one person's resumee look more impressive and if I sound overly critical if this video has been nothing
1:44:58
but complaints it's because in my job I encountered a lot of people who were frustrated with their phone systems and
1:45:04
there was really no reason that they needed to be that confusing I'm genuinely irritated that the best chance we ever had at getting a truly easy to
1:45:11
use PBX died on the vine solely because of where it was invented and after such a promising start too uh for all the
1:45:18
I've been talking there are things to admire about response point I think I pointed them out I have the feeling that
1:45:24
someone who worked on this did care did understand the problem space it wasn't all just clueless computer people the
1:45:31
very idea of starting with a question and answer format like who will answer calls that's a stroke of Genius that
1:45:38
could have been the spark of an excellent design pattern and initial reviews when it came out were very optimistic they called it the easiest
1:45:44
PBX on the market they were hoping for a bright future and so I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the whole thing
1:45:51
is just unfinished that it's basically beta that they pushed out to Market and intended to improve later and then
1:45:56
priorities shifted and nobody ever got to come back and add any of the missing bits and I mean that's literally not
1:46:02
true the service packs did add a bunch of features but it's all stuff that should have been there on day one like
1:46:08
paging T1 and PR support selectable hold music a call log and VOIP as it turns
1:46:15
out the first release couldn't actually connect to a Voiceover IP Gateway provider they had to add that at release
1:46:21
this supported analog phone lines and nothing else considering these machines cost over $2,400 that seems absurd even
1:46:30
given the state of the industry back then and even after those updates the product was still incredibly barebones
1:46:35
response Point needed a lot more work to even get to usable let alone good and it
1:46:41
was never going to get it at Microsoft what a shame anyway if you made it this
Outro
1:46:47
far I appreciate that it's uh hard for me to talk about phone stuff without either getting way too detailed or
1:46:53
letting years of frustration color my language hopefully I didn't do too much of either but the state of the industry
1:46:58
has always just irritated me especially since I used to work in the Middle where I couldn't really fix either end of the problem I I'll give more details on that
1:47:04
in future videos I'm sure they just need to be their own thing because this topic just goes on and on and on there's so
