so my name is Ellie I'm the managing
director of The alperovich Institute and
a lecturer in strategic studies at Johns
Hopkins University
uh this talk is TLP red simply
because we're working on a roll out uh
that involves a congressional briefing
and so we're going to be sharing that
those findings with Congress and I
don't want to steal that Thunder but I
still wanted to speak to give you
guys a sneak peak about what we'll be
sharing with them so oh going back
um about five months ago I was very high
on drugs in a basement in
Baltimore
and thank you you're
welcome and while and so for about three
days while I was in and out of
Consciousness I don't remember any of
this people told me I've done this I
told the entire ICU floor of the Johns
Hopkins University Hospital three
things about me I was very keen on them
knowing that I was a belly dancer I
may or may not have told them that I'm a
former spy and the third thing I really
really really wanted them to know was
who owns
Huawei so I'm gonna tell you who owns
Huawei before I do that I want to
start with the sort of animating
question that led to me looking at the
incorporation structure of firms and
that was a very simple question I
wanted to know how is Chinese foreign
direct investment triggering American
National Security concerns at the
time I was working in government and I
had to I used to cover the Middle East
and I had to cover a topic as far away
from my day job and this was it and I
was particularly interested in Chinese
foreign direct investment in critical
emerging Technologies at the time we
didn't even have a definition for what
sectors constitute critical and emerging
Technologies we did not have that until
uh the Biden Administration in October
of
2022 and so in order to answer this
question I had to look at three things
one I needed to look at how is
Chinese money moving around the world
who was spending it and What mechanisms
they were using to spend it so there are
uh since 2005 Chinese companies have
spent more than $2.5 trillion dollars
in foreign direct investment that 2.5
trillion is is in addition to 4.6
trillion annual tradein figure so
just in trade on top of other capital
flows like Venture Capital development
money Aid money the other thing to
keep in mind is that $2.5 trillion only
accounts for transactions that were made
above 100 million so any transaction
below 100 million we simply are blind on
we don't know who bought whom for how
much that 2.5 trillion was spent by
672 Chinese companies 51% of them are
private firms the rest are state-owned
Enterprises however 80 83% of that 2.5
trillion was spent by state-owned
Enterprises and so because of that we
have this very unhealthy obsession with
state-owned Enterprises and we've always
had that Obsession that's why in
1975 President Ford set up cfus by
executive order the committee on foreign
investment in the United States cifas
is probably the sexiest most interesting
most secretive inter agency body they
report directly to the president so they
don't have to go through anyone the
president has never said no to them uh
the president has always agreed with
their recommendations and so and
the Only Rule that they had from
inception is that any transaction in the
United States that was made by a state
owned Enterprise would be flagged so
we've always been very worried about
State
ownership
um this idea this obsession with State
ownership is I think this is the
wrong slide but that's okay
uh this uh obsession with State
ownership is what lead led me to look at
the strategy of Economic statecraft and
that's the intentional attempt by the
state to manipulate coer or
incentivize a company to behave in a way
that advances the National Security
goals of the state remember FDI is done
by companies unlike trade which is uh
negotiated by countries and so you would
you are not supposed to see much uh
government foot print within foreign
direct investment and so because of
this idea of economic statecraft we
don't know whether it's a strategy or a
grand strategy I looked at how is the
Chinese government basically
instrumentalizing economic statecraft
to influence the behavior of Chinese
firms doing the foreign direct
investment and so I looked at two
different things I looked at uh
legislation and I looked at the
incorporation of firms for the past
10 years China
has been revising their a bunch
several of their legislations
including the 2015 National Security uh
law the 2017 National Intelligence law
the 2006 company law the 2019 foreign
investment law last year they also
revised the 2014 counter Espionage law
and they wrote an AI law that
is right now open for comment and so
they have done three things in these
revisions one they have redefined the
conceptu iation of what is National SEC
Chinese National Security the second
thing they did is strengthen the
authority of the state and the third
thing they did which is the part that's
really interesting to me is that they uh
basically included Provisions in all of
these laws that obligate individ Chinese
individuals and Chinese entities which
would include firms to help the state if
the state asks them okay and if you are
following the Tik Tock debate that
that is at the heart of it is the
legislation is because of those laws
it's not necessarily because Tik Tok is
owned by B dance which is a private
company so how have we failed in our
National Security reviews the first uh
place where we have failed we do not we
are so obsessed with ownership State
ownership that we did not pay enough
attention to sector and so if you
look at this chart here sectors like
agriculture energy transport
utilities barely register any national
Security reviews utilities include our
critical infrastructure agriculture you
guys heard from uh from the earlier
talk on this energy was probably
our biggest shortcoming right now
that includes critical minerals and
right now the White House has a strong
push towards trying to catch up with
China there and the only sectors that
registered some National Security
reviews were the technology real estate
and health sectors and all of those uh
sectors were actually reactionary to
different we're actually reactionary
to different transactions that happened
and then few years later cfus realized
it happened freaked out and then forced
a divestiture so for instance the real
estate bucket that is because in
2014 mbang Insurance Group a Chinese
Equity Firm basically bought the
Waldo for Storia in in New York and then
a year later the Chinese government
nationalized that private Equity so now
the Waldo foror is owned by the Chinese
government grinder you must be fil
with with the app Chinese company tried
to buy grinder a few years later we
realized you know access to biometric
data Etc and so now we have rules uh
around around flagin for National
Security concerned for any transactions
that involve biometric data but the
point is we did not pay attention to
sector because we're obsessed with State
ownership the the other way we have
failed is that we don't not we don't
seem to care what what is happening in
the rest of the world outside of the US
and Europe and because of that we have
uh Chinese companies Domina in Telecom
sector in Africa we have Chinese ZTE for
instance runs most satellites in
Latin America we have a Chinese
company that owns a percentage of the
Italian Postal Service we have Chinese
companies that own freshwater
reserves in Australia and so we've
seem to have missed the ball on paying
attention to what's going on in the
rest of the
world the other way we have failed is
that we focus on state ownership and
this is what I want to focus on today
uh because we focus so much on on uh
state-owned Enterprises we don't seem we
missed the ball and we did not realize
that the actual threat is
within so how do Chinese firms and the
government and by extension the CCP
evade National Security scrutiny the one
way they do it is by simply
restructuring government owned uh
government-owned entities particularly
uh government owned entities at the
provincial level into llc's and LTDs
they don't change anything other than uh
they restructure them the other way they
do it is by burying the investment
through many levels of incorporation of
subsidiaries indirect subsidiaries and
related entities the other very
problematic way they do it is by making
Investments through private Equity
holding companies wealth managers
Sovereign wealth fund asset management
companies in fact China set up four
different asset management companies
that just handle overseas Investments
um they also do it through silent
ownerships this is when a company
comes in buys another company doesn't
tell anyone no press release they don't
change anything that's what happened uh
a few year ago a few years ago with
Spitz field food the largest pork
processor in the United States it is now
wholly owned by by a Chinese company
they did not change anything a few years
later cus realized that happened too
late it's owned by a Chinese company
now and another way they do it is simply
by banking it American they come and
they make a they register a company
right here in the United States they
even have asset management and private
Equity firms in Pao Alto and so those
are American companies they technically
are not even supposed to fall under
cious perview unless you can trace
the incorporation to a Chinese firm uh
another way they do it is by investing
in very very Niche markets like very
small beautiful like wholesome American
companies that you would never never uh
suspect that they are linked to the
Chinese government or are Incorporated
within Chinese within Chinese
investment companies another way they
do it is through red chip companies
these are Chinese government-owned
companies that are listed in the Hong
kok State Stock Exchange uh
purposefully explicitly for uh
investing overseas my personal
favorite is the reverse IPOs and the
mures and Acquisitions a reverse IPO is
when a public company buys a private
company so that that private company now
is listed without having to disclose
anything they do it through
investment funds this is when you have a
big fund where you have some CH some
government money mixed in with other
private sector money and then the fund
makes the investment and you don't
realize who has control in share and
therefore who actually owns who is
the largest owner of of that
particular entity they do it through
imeds this is particularly true of like
the big Chinese companies like
Alibaba Buu Etc this this is when you
simply have Chinese government
officials go basically hang out with
people at Buu or Alibaba and finally
another one of my favorites is the
unicorns I spent the last 10 years uh
tracking Chinese unicorns particularly
in the biotech sector this is when
you would make a very small investment
maybe $1 million into a startup or even
less than a million dollars and then 10
years later that startup turns into
the biggest genomics company in the
world which is what happens with bgi
genomics so what does the anatomy of a
firm look like and how can you hide
within it so when I've so I've spent the
last 10 years tracing the incorporation
of firms and for the past few uh
couple of years I have been looking
at tracing the incorporation of firms
of companies that are of particular
interest to Congress people because they
either want to ban them or they want to
have some sort of legislation to try to
attempt to develop some policy or
legislative solution
uh to them so this is the
incorporation structure of
Huawei Huawei is owned by the union of
Huawei investment and holding company
that parent company is has two
shareholders one is the chief executive
of Huawei who owns a little bit over 1%
and the rest is owned supposedly by the
people the the union okay Huawei has 56
subsidiaries three related entities uh
there mostly structured as
representatives of Huawei in different
countries so Huawei Spain Huawei Morocco
Huawei whatever except for four
different subsidiaries one of them is
Tonga networks which is the Huawei
Israeli R&D Center the other one is m4s
which is an acquisition that huawe
made of one of Belgium's biggest
semiconductor companies the third one
is H silicon Technologies which is the
biggest designer of integrated circuits
uh in China and the fourth one is my
favorite it's a mysterious little LLC
called Huawei Tech investment Oman I
don't know what they're doing but I'm
very keen on finding out this
incorporation look if you look at the
incorporation structure of Coca-Cola or
Walmart it would look kind of like this
okay so for me Huawei is a national
champion for China a company that owns
its entire supply chain it's has a div I
ified portfolio where they have a big
footprint on other Supply chains so
absolutely they're important absolutely
they're to be reckoned with but this is
for me more of a market issue this is an
economic issue we should pay attention
to them because they are too big to fill
because they own parts of Supply chains
Etc but from a national security like
Chinese infiltration perspective this is
not how you would do it because we all
care about Huawei we're all watching
Huawei okay this is BG the Incorporation
structure of bgi genomics bgi genomics
was started in 1999 by four Chinese
scientists they got very famous this
was 24 years 25 years ago they got very
famous for
um mapping the uh the Genome of rice
uh and they also did the genome for uh
the SARS virus BG genomics has very
very close and many many ties to the
Chinese government they had funding from
the Chinese government from their
provincial government where in hungu
Province where they are listed they
have set up genomics research institutes
in different Chinese universities they
uh teamed up with the Chinese government
to set up Beijing genomic Institute
and then one of those for funders is now
the head of the beian genomic Institute
they have done research they've
published research with the Chinese
military they do not hide their ties
okay bgi genomics has 24 indirect
subsidiaries 23 subsidiaries but they
are but BGR genomics owns BGR genomics
there's not an investment uh holding
company that owns them this is another
there are five of these subsidiaries are
listed in the on the entity on the
Commerce Department's entities list for
alleged violations of human rights
um and BG genomics if any of you has had
a covid test or a prenatal test you have
most likely used a equipment from bgi
genomics they are the largest genomic uh
uh sequencing equipment supplier to
the United States and so there is a big
in earlier this year in January there
was a big push there is a a piece of
legislation that is trying to ban BG
genomics from the United States this is
another company that I think is a
distraction they do work in genomics
it's a Frontiers critical and
emerging technology we know it's
sensitive if you are trying to if you
are the government trying to infiltrate
or buy things you are not going to do it
through BG genomics right you know we
are watching this
okay this is the incorporation structure
of a company another company that
Congress wants to B called Pharma Wy
Pharma aptech Wy Pharma aptech is one of
the subsidiaries in this tree so what we
did for Congress is basically tracked
incorporation of this company that they
want to ban wsie far Wy aptech and what
we when we when we mapped the
incorporation we were able to track tra
trace it back to its parent company Wy
pharmatech registered in the Cayman
Islands and what we were also able to
do is identify its sister subsidiaries
there were 20 of them okay so we thought
that was great and then we digged into
the incorporation of Wy Farm Tech Cayman
so the parent company of the company
that Congress wants to B and when we did
that we found that that parent company
in the Cayman Islands itself had merged
with another company called wsie merger
limited which
itself is a is a subsidiary of another
company called new Wookie life science
limited okay so Congress wants to bend
one company does not know where it sits
in its ecosystem we helped them do that
we trace it back to a parent company and
we identify its sister subsidiaries 20
of them and then when we look at into
the parent company we realize that that
parent company has a parent company who
is a subsidiary of another parent
company okay so ultimate parent has a
parent who has a parent three levels of
incorporation is the firm that Congress
wants to ban so this is an example where
you're not very one of the reasons why
I'm not a big fan of banss is because
they are very disruptive to a whole
supply chain one and so you can
disrupt that supply chain and other
Supply chains and two without knowing
the incorporation of the firm you cannot
it's not surgical it's like cutting
bread with a
machete okay this
is oh and then forgot one more
thing when we went into the parent that
owns the parent that owns the parent
that D owns the company that Congress
wants to ban we looked at we followed
the money at that ultimate parent level
and we found that the biggest sh uh
shareholder is actually a private
investment fund which ties to Chinese
money okay so here you have money coming
in from the investment fund at the
parent company and then the
incorporation affirms buried and many
levels of subsidiaries and
incorporation this is perhaps my
favorite because it's so simple okay Bon
holding LLC is an a company registered
in a America it owns Defender Capital
LLC Defender Capital LLC is a family run
uh company that manages rich people's uh
Rich individual families or corporations
money Bon Holden in 2019 purchased a
company called xynomic Pharmaceuticals
for $350 million so I looked into the
incorporation of Bisson holding LLC and
what I found is that lovely Bisson
holding LLC is actually a blank check
company that was set up by ban Capital
holding company limited to buy xynomic
to merge not buy to merge with xynomic
pharmaceutical okay so a capital holding
uh holding company makes a blank check
company registers it in the British
Virgin Islands merges with
pharmaceutical company makes that
pharmaceutical company a holding company
and then as a condition for that merger
the the the blank check company had to
Red domesticate from the British Virgin
Islands to Delaware and then when you
have that redomestication holding
company in Delaware you then have
that company merge into another
subsidiary of the blank check company
that it merged with in the first place
okay and when they did that suddenly
xenomic became NASDAQ listed without
having to do any disclosure
you got to love
lawyers okay these two snapshots are the
entirety of the website of Bisson
holding
LLC the
entirety okay last one this is the
incorporation structure of dalan hexing
investment Co dalion hexing investment
Co owns another company called dalion
film holding so you have an investment
company that owns uh a holding
company dalan film Holdings owns 210
subsidiaries 85 indir subsidiaries eight
related entities all buried and there 15
levels of
incorporation okay so I'm going to tell
you the story of two of these trees at
the seventh level of incorporation that
tree at the very at the very my left
um and then I'm going to tell you the
story of the Incorporation of firms at
the 12 13 and 14 levels so at the very
bottom right of the tree
so since 2011 Chinese companies have
spent more than10 billion doar buying
companies in the entertainment sector in
the US they've purchased for instance
AMC International 100% they own the
whole thing the 10-cent purchased RI
Riot games now they are one of the top
three U gaming companies and the
other big acquisition was the
acquisition of legendary entertainment
this is the company that brought you the
hangover movies and dune this
legendary owns Amy polar smart girls and
they also own Asylum entertainment which
is a company that does virtual
reality gaming when I looked at the the
so a company at the sixth level of
incorporation called the Wanda called
the dalan Wanda group they purchased
legendary so we went down one to the
seventh level of incorporation when I
looked at this tree there was another
investment firm that came in two years
ago
and purchase 760 million minority share
into legendary with ties to the
Chinese government so in this particular
case you have seventh levels of
incorporation that links legendary
entertainment to a holding company
that's owned by an Investment company uh
Chinese Investment Company and you have
an investment firm coming in at the
seventh level of incorporation and
buying even more
shares okay this is one tree the other
tree this is another one of my favorites
I call these guys like every day
pretending to be Jessica and Iman so
IMU Holdings is a registered company
LLC company in Tampa Florida they
uh have offices in this lovely Suite
across from a Panera Bread on Martha
Luther Kings Boulevard they have been
religiously doing discl annual
reports every year since 2016 they
are they are overseen by a company
called coin Global which is basically a
company that offers Services a bunch of
res registered agents there there is
exactly one person that works at this
company he is the chief legal uh
officer and the secretary this man
what I what what I noticed when I looked
him up is that his listed address and
phone number and Company was actually
the address and Company and phone number
of another sister subsidiary at the 12th
level of incorporation so two levels up
that company also has only one person
who's the president and CEO who
has the same of that company called
World Triathlon corporation and they
apparently organize races okay I do not
know what IMU Holdings does they exist
but I don't know what they
do all right one more
I live in Bethesda so this is where I go
on vacation this is another company
at the 13th level of incorporation uh
called Chesapeake Bay Bridge Run LLC
they also organize races so they look
very American American company does
American things by the Chesapeake Ray
bridge if you link it if you trace it 13
back of incorporation you trace it back
to an an investment holding company that
is owned by an Investment company a
Chinese Investment Company
last one this is Windy City Publishers
this is another subsidiary from another
tree at the 14th level of incorporation
this company has like three pages the
very weird website is claims to be a
boutique firm that will help you publish
your
book again you would never be able to
link it 14th levels up to a Chinese
investment to a Chinese holding
company that's owned by a Chinese
Investment Company so our obsession with
state-owned Enterprises is a distraction
because when we look at the
incorporation of the firms the threat is
very much within and is very very buried
in the details so if we are if we want
to develop policy Solutions in order to
address this issue we need to have a
better idea of the incorporation of
firms so how do we catch them one
understand that the threat is within two
transparency we need transparency into
the the incorporation of firms the
structure of firms and the ownership of
firms and specifically we need money
managers to tell us whose money that
they are managing but that's very hard
to get them to do my brother is an
investment banker and he was like yeah
hell
no but until then what we can do is have
cfus H is Empower cfus with more rules
they need to have more parameters that
are concrete precise and preemptive so
that they are able to flag these
transactions before they happen or at
least in real time because so far it it
their work has always been
reactionary transaction goes through a
few years later we free couch because we
realize we let it happen and then we
force a divesture so since 1975 most
companies were cus asked for a
divesture the companies said yes the
reason why Tik Tok is such a big
momental case is because it's the first
time a company actually says no we'll
take you to court
okay so to do that I started the bul
dragon project last year I teamed up
with the John's Hopkins Applied
Physics lab a BN a bunch of wonderful
engineers and technologists and they
have worked with me to map these
incorporation structures of all these
672 firms and based on the lessons
learned from that research we are now
developing uh we we've developed a
methodology a code book of r rules that
is specific to geography nature of
sector and we go down into very
concrete details and So based on these
rules this is an example from the
rule for elections and digital
infrastructure we are able to build
this system that will be able to scrape
in real time the thousands of
transaction the hundreds of thousands of
transactions that are happening every
day and flag them so that cifas has a
way they're not they are not looking at
a they're not lost at C so that they're
able able to preemptively flag uh
transactions that they should be looking
at so I spent a lot I we have a
wonderful project right now that we are
working on that looks into the gaming
sector I spent the summer reading
about rootkits it's there're it's
kind of cool they you can do a lot of
things with that
um yeah so if if any of you I I'm
obviously not the expert in that so if
any of you are interested at all in Tim
up with us we're looking at unknown
unknowns and known unknowns and sort of
the gaming sector is one where we are
hoping to to to do something with
Congress on that particular sphere
you guys are the experts in that so if
you're at all interested please I'm
happy to talk with you guys about
this this is another rule for the
internet of things for instance uh
that's a little bit more broad this is
another rule for supercomputing and
Biometrics and I think I have one more
rule for unicorns so if you are
at all interested please find me I would
love to chat with you please follow
us on bulld dragon. org and otherwise
Mercy vku for listening
[Applause]
